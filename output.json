Pratt also offers searing critiques of Trump’s personal ethics.\n   \n      CNN   that Pratt gave an interview to special counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump with mishandling national security materials by hoarding dozens of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. (Trump pleaded not guilty.) Pratt is also on Smith’s witness list for the trial, which is scheduled for May.\n   \n      Concerns about Trump’s freewheeling approach to state secrets are at the center of that case. Past reports from ABC News said Trump discussed potentially sensitive information with Pratt about US nuclear submarines. The new reports Sunday expand what is known about Pratt’s recounting of their conversations to include foreign policy matters.\n   \n      “It hadn’t even been on the news yet, and he said, ‘I just bombed Iraq today,’” Pratt said in one recording that was made public Sunday, recalling a conversation with Trump.\n   \n      Pratt then recalled Trump’s description of his December 2019 call with Iraqi President Barham Salih. According to Pratt, Trump said, “The president of Iraq called me up and said, ‘You just leveled my city. … I said to him, ‘OK, what are you going to do about it?’”\n   \n      The recordings also indicate that Trump spoke with Pratt about his now-infamous September 2019  , in which Trump pressured Zelensky to help him win the 2020 election by publicly launching unfounded corruption probes into Joe Biden. That phone call formed the basis of Trump’s first impeachment.\n   \n      “That was nothing compared to what I usually do,” Trump told Pratt about the Zelensky call, according to the tape. “That’s nothing compared to what we usually talk about.”\n   \n      In statements to The New York Times, Trump pointed out that Pratt is “from a friendly country in Australia, one of our great allies,” though he didn’t deny the conversations described in the tapes. A Trump spokesperson said the tapes “lack proper context.”\n   \n      CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign and Pratt’s company, Visy, for comment.\n   \n      These latest disclosures could be used by Smith’s prosecutors as evidence that Trump had a pattern of   with unauthorized people, including political donors and well-connected businessmen in his orbit. It’s unclear whether prosecutors already had possession of the tapes that were made public on Sunday.\n   \n      The new recordings also shed light on Pratt’s candid, private thoughts about Trump’s behavior. It’s unclear who Pratt was speaking to, but Pratt said in one tape that Trump “says outrageous things nonstop,” and compared his business practices to “the mafia.”\n   \n      “He knows exactly what to say — and what not to say — so that he avoids jail. But gets so close to it that it looks to everyone like he’s breaking the law,” Pratt said in one tape.\n  "},

And, you know, looking the other way in the face of the kind of assault on our democracy that we’ve seen from Donald Trump and his allies in the House,” Cheney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”\n   \n      Her comments come amid the House GOP’s high-stakes speakership battle after McCarthy was ousted more than two weeks ago. Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race, prompting a crowded candidate field to seek the speakership.\n   \n      Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.\n   \n      Cheney, who was one of Trump’s strongest critics in Congress, said Sunday she has also “been watching the extent to which political violence and the threats of violence have now reared their head once again. Those have become part of our politics in a way that certainly they never should.”\n   \n      Several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s House speakership bid   since casting their votes.\n   \n      “Now, that kind of acceptance of violence is completely inappropriate and dangerous in our politics. So, I – we need people who are serious and who recognize and understand the dangers that we’re facing globally, as well as from Donald Trump and those who support him,” she said. \n   \n      Trump, Cheney added, “is the single most dangerous threat we face” as a nation.\n   \n      “He cannot be the next president. If he is, all of the things that he attempted to do but was stopped from doing by responsible people around him at the Department of Justice, at the White House Counsel’s office, he will do. There will be no guardrails and everyone has been warned.”\n  "},
{"title": "\n      Redistricting fights in these 10 states could determine which party controls the US House\n    ", "author": "Fredreka Schouten", "timestamp": "\n  Published\n        11:03 AM EDT, Sun October 22, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n      Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.\n   \n      In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature   that could flip as many as four Democratic-held seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats in legal skirmishes now playing out in New York, Louisiana, Georgia and other states.\n   \n      In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a five-seat edge in the US House. That razor-edge majority has been underscored in recent weeks by   to elect a new speaker. \n   \n      “Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.\n   \n      And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”\n   \n      Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the  .\n   \n      They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a   that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.\n   \n      In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US  , which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n   \n      That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.\n   \n      Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.\n   \n      In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans control the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while the job could fall to Democrats in New York, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.\n   \n      “Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”\n   \n      Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:\n   \n      In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama   that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.\n   \n      The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming   that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.\n   \n      The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.\n   \n      The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.\n   \n      Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections. \n   \n      The new map – approved in recent days by the lower-court judges – also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history. \n   \n      A state judge in September   for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the   had improperly diluted Black voting power. \n   \n      This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.\n   \n      The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.” \n   \n      Arguments before an appeals court are slated for later this month, with litigants seeking a decision by late November. The case is expected to land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.\n   \n      A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.\n   \n      But observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine whether Florida lawmakers must restore the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.\n   \n      A redistricting case now before a federal judge could create a more competitive seat for Democrats in the Atlanta suburbs.\n   \n      The plaintiffs challenging the congressional map drawn by Georgia Republicans argue that the increasingly diverse population in the Peach State should result in an additional Black-majority district, this one in the western Atlanta metro area. A trial in the case recently concluded and awaits a final ruling by US District Judge Steve Jones.\n   \n      In 2022, Jones preliminarily ruled that some parts of the Republicans’ redistricting plan likely violated federal law but allowed the map to be used in that year’s midterm elections.\n   \n      A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds and is slated to go to trial next month.\n   \n      Currently, Republicans hold nine of the 14 seats in Georgia’s congressional delegation. Black people make up a majority, or close to it, in four districts, including three in the Atlanta area. \n   \n      The Kentucky Supreme Court could soon decide whether a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature amounts to what Democrats assert is an “extreme partisan” gerrymander in violation of the state’s constitution.\n   \n      Much of the case focuses on disputes over state legislative maps, but the congressional lines also are at stake, with critics saying lawmakers moved Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District to help shore up Republican odds of holding the 6th District.\n   \n      The 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Andy Barr, was one of the more competitive seats in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath   of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines  .)\n   \n      A lower-court judge already has ruled that the Republican-drawn map does not violate the state’s constitution. \n   \n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Alabama could pave the way for a new congressional map in Louisiana ahead of the 2024 election, but the case has quickly become mired in appeals.\n   \n      Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker in its six-member congressional delegation. \n   \n      A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year. \n   \n      Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.\n   \n      Louisiana Republicans have filed an appeal with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and successfully halted a district court hearing to discuss imposing a new, court-ordered map. \n   \n      On Thursday, the US Supreme Court   the federal district judge to move forward with discussions about drawing a new map while the appeal advances through the courts.\n   \n      GOP state officials say, among other things, that they are seeking time to redraw the map themselves. Critics of the state’s original map argue that Republicans are using legal maneuvers to delay a new redistricting plan, which could result in a second Democratic-leaning seat.\n   \n      Legal battles that drag on risk judges invoking the  , a doctrine that limits changing voting procedures and boundaries too close to Election Day to guard against voter confusion.\n   \n      “Some of the reason it becomes too late is because, in many of these cases, the state is prolonging the litigation … and buying more time with an illegal map,” said Kareem Crayton, senior director for voting and representation at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.\n   \n      Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.\n   \n      At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.\n   \n      A state judge recently upheld the map drawn by Democrats, but the New Mexico Supreme Court is expected to review that order on appeal.\n   \n      Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.\n   \n      Current legal fights in the Empire State over redistricting, however, could erase those gains.\n   \n      A state court judge oversaw last year’s process of   following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan redistricting commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory earlier this year when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should draw new lines. \n   \n      Republicans have appealed that decision, and oral arguments are set for mid-November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. The commission’s map-making also is on hold.\n   \n      If Democrats prevail, it could make it easier for their party to pick up as many as six seats now held by Republicans.\n   \n      North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, is drawing new congressional lines that observers could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.\n   \n      The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.\n   \n      Two proposed maps released in recent days, however, would put three House Democrats in “almost impossible to win” districts, said Chris Cooper, a political science professor and redistricting expert at Western Carolina University.\n   \n      The affected Democrats would be Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina.\n   \n      One of the plans under consideration could also knock off a fourth Democrat because it would draw two of the state’s three Black House lawmakers – Reps. Don Davis and Valerie Foushee – into the same district. Under the other proposal, Davis would not face off against Foushee, but his seat would become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.\n   \n      State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year   by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.\n   \n      A map that had been created after the   resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.\n   \n      Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation.\n   \n      A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for   in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.\n   \n      Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\n   \n      The Republican lawmakers  . And, during oral arguments earlier this month, several justices in the court’s conservative majority   that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.\n   \n      The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.\n   \n      Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.\n   \n      Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.\n   \n      Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”\n   \n      Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.\n  "},

He is also under a gag order in that case, and that judge, Arthur Engoron, fined Trump $5,000 on Friday for violating the gag order after a social media post targeting a court employee was left up on Trump’s campaign website. \n   \n      Engoron said future violations could even  .\n   \n      The court developments are an important reminder that as Trump cruises toward the Republican presidential nomination, at least according to public opinion polls, he is also in very real legal peril – something Trump acknowledged, before the gag-order-related threat from Engoron in New York, when the former president talked about the prospect of prison during an event in Clive, Iowa.\n   \n      “What they don’t understand is that I am willing to go to jail if that’s what it takes for our country to win and become a democracy again,” Trump said at the rally.\n   \n      There is some bizarre irony in the comments since he’s charged in connection with trying to subvert an election, one of the fundamental pillars of democracy.\n   \n      Former New Jersey Gov.

Republicans, determined to fight a civil war over fractures in the conservative movement, seem oblivious to the degenerating global stability all around them or the shutdown threat directly in front of them. \n   \n      The vacuum is rendering one branch of the US government inoperable, since the Senate can’t pass laws without the other chamber. “We need (a speaker) because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday. \n   \n      The imbroglio is far more serious than the classic congressional drama wherein lawmakers procrastinate and work through their political rituals, and then finally get their acts together. In a practical sense, the absence of a speaker means the House cannot support Israel in accordance with a new aid request from President Joe Biden. A critical and bitter debate over new Ukraine funding – $60 billion of which was requested by Biden last week – cannot begin. Before long, the blocked US lifeline could have grave consequences in Ukraine’s war for survival and boost Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is betting US resolve will wane – not a bad wager considering increasing GOP resistance to defending the democratic government in Kyiv.\n   \n      But forget reverberations overseas. The House meltdown could soon begin to harm millions of Americans. The GOP has wasted three of the precious weeks that it had to solve a spending showdown that could shut down the government by the middle of November. Even if the party suddenly moves quickly toward choosing a new leader, it’s unlikely much serious work gets done this week either.\n   \n      The empty speaker’s chair offers an eloquent metaphor for how internal political chaos is compromising American leadership. It’s also threatening the more-than-two-centuries-long experiment in self-government by the people that relies ultimately on no one getting everything they want but accepting incremental change. That’s a concept that the modern GOP seems to reject – as evidenced by the claims of Donald Trump and many of his acolytes in the House that they have the right to rule even though the former president’s bid for a second term was rejected by voters in 2020.\n   \n      The House Republican conference is showing that it cannot even compromise with itself, let alone construct a unified position before eventually accepting the trade-offs that will be needed in dealing with a Democratic-run Senate and White House. Whichever Republican finally wins the speakership will face similar questions to the ones that eventually cost McCarthy his dream job – namely whether to indulge far-right Republicans with extreme spending cuts that the White House and the Senate will never accept, or to avert a government shutdown by advancing stopgap funding with some Democratic votes. Unless a new speaker can change the dynamic, their tenure risks being even shorter than that of the California Republican.\n   \n      A new speaker will also be hampered by the reality that chaos and a neutered government are a welcome outcome for many grassroots Republicans in a party transformed by Trump. Many of these lawmakers have perfected the extremism that hedges against primary challenges and the cacophony that pleases the ratings-driven demands of conservative media. Influence in the GOP is no longer bought by years of service that paves the way for committee chairmanships. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the eight Republicans who voted to can McCarthy, understands the equation well – which is one reason why senior figures bemoaning the need to “govern” aren’t persuading rabble-rousing members. The most obvious representative of this style of stunt politics Republicanism is Trump – who, despite being impeached twice, falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and facing four criminal trials, is the runaway front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination. \n   \n      Sheer fatigue in the House GOP may create an opening for a candidate who could become a weak speaker with no national name recognition but who could attract the least rancor from across the divided conference. Until then, serious Republican legislators in the House only have the power to express dismay as America’s enemies delight in watching US democracy founder.\n   \n      “This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen because if we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern. And every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News’ “This Week.”\n   \n      McCarthy, who supported Jordan but is now backing House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the situation cannot be allowed to endure much longer. “This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It’s embarrassing for the nation, and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” the former speaker said.\n   \n      Emmer is among nine GOP candidates seeking to lock down votes ahead of an expected secret ballot to pick a speaker nominee on Tuesday. The Minnesota Republican’s problem, however, is much like McCarthy’s – he is likely to struggle to win the support of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that reviles the GOP leadership team.\n   \n      The other members throwing their hat into a ring that does not include a single woman are Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee; Jack Bergman of Michigan, a mainstream conservative and Marine veteran; Austin Scott of Georgia, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week but quickly dropped out; Byron Donalds of Florida, a rising star Freedom Caucus member and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress; Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the GOP conference vice chairman; Pete Sessions of Texas, a congressional veteran who lost his seat in 2018 and soon returned to represent another one; Dan Meuser, a former Pennsylvania secretary of revenue and member of the Problem Solvers Caucus; and Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee.\n   \n      Newt Gingrich – a former Republican speaker who is credited with inventing back in the 1990s the highly partisan style of hardball governing preferred by today’s GOP – said party leaders must choose anyone who can get to a House majority regardless of who they are, or the charade could go on for weeks. And he warned with critical government funding and budget bills looming, the GOP doesn’t just have to unite on a new speaker but on a new period of unified governance.\n   \n      “That 217 has to be committed not just to elect a speaker, but to stick together for the next five or six months. They got big decisions coming down the road,” Gingrich told Fox News. “There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody, and three or four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess. \n   \n      “So they need to pick somebody to get stability.”\n   \n      Putting aside the irony of those words coming from the firebrand Georgia Republican, the House GOP has shown over the last three weeks that stability is the last thing the party is able, or even wants, to deliver.\n  "},
{"title": "\n      The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024\n    ", "author": "Simone Pathe", "timestamp": "\n  Published\n        12:03 PM EDT, Sun October 22, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n      While events on the other side of the world – and the other  – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections. \n   \n      The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.  \n   \n      The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from   to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary. \n   \n      GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.  \n   \n      Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however,   tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks. \n   \n      The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.  \n   \n      Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined  to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack. \n   \n      It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences. \n   \n      Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024: \n   \n       \n   \n      West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)  \n   \n      Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump.  , for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while   has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.  \n   \n      The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing   calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who   in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a   that there were more bears than people in Montana.)  \n   \n      Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been  trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his   and using   to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as   reported.  \n   \n      An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly   to Democrats, is   – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million. \n   \n       \n   \n      Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of   to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.  \n   \n      Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for  last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)  \n   \n      Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.  \n   \n       \n   \n      The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive   in late September. (  announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)  \n   \n      But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s    \n   \n      Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a   released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told   she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.  \n   \n      But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.  \n   \n      The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.  \n   \n      National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an   that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown. \n   \n      The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including   during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his   with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.  \n   \n      Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.  \n   \n      Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a  .  \n   \n      Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)  \n   \n      The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.  \n   \n      But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.  \n   \n       \n   \n      Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell   her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.  \n   \n      Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital   casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.  \n   \n      Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.  \n  "},

See you there!” Cohen posted on the social media site  . \n   \n      Trump is expected to attend the trial on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to two sources close to the former president, who said the details were still being finalized. \n   \n      Cohen was previously scheduled to testify this week but it was delayed after he cited a medical issue. Whenever he does appear, Cohen’s testimony will be the latest in a series of high-profile public clashes between Trump and his onetime “fixer” over the past several years.  \n   \n      A longtime attorney of the former president before he occupied the Oval Office, Cohen had been one of Trump’s closest allies, famously pledging years ago that he would “take a bullet” for his then-boss.  \n   \n      The relationship deteriorated after the start of Trump’s presidency, and broke down fully in public view after   in which he and Trump can be heard discussing how they would buy the rights to former Playboy model Karen McDougal’s story about an alleged affair she had with Trump years earlier, which Trump denies.   \n   \n      Cohen later provided dramatic testimony to a House committee about Trump’s involvement in the hush-money scheme involving both McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who also alleges Trump had an affair with her. (Trump has also denied that affair.)   \n   \n      New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office has said it opened its investigation after Cohen alleged during his congressional testimony that Trump inflated the value of his properties to get better interest rates on loans and insurance. \n   \n      Cohen is also a central figure in the hush money criminal case brought against Trump by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump was indicted in March on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The charges relate to how he reimbursed Cohen, who made a $130,000 payment to stop Daniels from going public days before the 2016 election about the alleged affair with Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case.  \n   \n      Cohen’s 2019 congressional testimony came just before Cohen reported to prison for a three-year sentence after he pleaded guilty to tax crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress in 2017. \n   \n      In 2020, in which he apologized for his role in the rise of Trump, whom he describes as “a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man” and a person interested in using the presidency exclusively for his personal financial benefit. \n   \n      Earlier this month, Trump abruptly dropped a lawsuit he had brought against Cohen in April that alleged his former attorney breached his professional obligations as Trump’s confidant and attorney through the publication of his books as well as podcasts and media appearances.    \n  "},

While Trump has vowed to fight until the bitter end, these newly inked plea deals force his co-defendants to confront the same difficult choice: cut a deal or roll the dice at trial.\n   \n      For two prominent Trump co-defendants –   and   – the looming five-month trial, potentially resulting in a yearslong prison sentence, appears to have spurred them into flipping. \n   \n      Their decisions to transform from Trump diehards to key witness against him have likely shattered any sense of invincibility that the former president or others charged may be feeling – perhaps for the first time.\n   \n      Chesebro pleaded guilty Friday to a felony conspiracy charge, admitting he worked with Trump and other members of the former president’s inner circle to overturn the 2020 election by putting forward slates of fake Republican electors in multiple states that Trump lost.  \n   \n      Chesebro directly implicated Trump in a criminal conspiracy, and his plea establishes for the first time that the fake electors plot was illegal. Notably, Chesebro has now admitted that “the purpose” of the fake electors conspiracy was to “disrupt and delay the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” which is a key element of the federal charges Trump is facing.\n   \n      As part of the plea, Chesebro established that the fake electors plot was part of “an attempt… to violate” the US Constitution and federal law, by subverting the Electoral College proceedings. This dovetails with the allegations against Trump in  .\n   \n      On Thursday, former Trump campaign lawyer Powell pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a separate, but complementary, effort to interfere with the 2020 election by breaching Georgia voting systems.\n   \n      While Powell’s guilty plea only covers charges related to the breach of election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia, her deal with prosecutors opens the door for testimony about first-hand interactions with Trump and other key co-defendants. \n   \n      For example, if called to the stand in a future trial, Powell could face questions about White House meetings she attended where Trump considered taking extreme steps to overturn the 2020 results, like ordering the Pentagon to seize voting machines.  \n   \n      Chesebro similarly agreed to cooperate fully with Fulton County investigators as part of his deal – which includes testifying against Trump and other defendants if called as a witness.  \n   \n      Trump is the only person charged thus far in the federal case, but both Chesebro and Powell are unindicted co-conspirators. Chesebro has now admitted conspiring with Trump in the same fake elector plot that is featured prominently in the federal case against Trump – which is set for trial in March.  \n   \n      Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead counsel in the Georgia election subversion case, responded Friday to Chesebro’s guilty plea by suggesting it was likely motivated by the “looming threat of prison time.”                                                                                                                                                                \n   \n      He speculated in a statement that Chesebro’s guilty plea “was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team, and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time.”\n   \n      Trump’s attorney also pointed out that prosecutors dismissed Chesebro’s separate racketeering charge that underpins the indictment against all 19 co-defendants, including the former president. Prosecutors have now dropped that RICO charge against all three defendants who have already taken plea deals.\n   \n      But just because a onetime Trump loyalist has decided to help prosecutors go after him, that doesn’t mean the former president is doomed.\n   \n      Back in 2018, Trump’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors and implicated Trump in an illegal campaign finance conspiracy – but the Justice Department never charged Trump with that alleged crime. But Cohen has cooperated with New York state investigators and is   at Trump’s civil business fraud trial there. \n   \n      Sadow brushed off the threat of possible testimony from Chesebro and Powell at Trump’s eventual trial on the Georgia election subversion charges.\n   \n      “Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy,” Sadow said.  \n   \n       \n  "},

As he climbed the stairs to Air Force One, the president responded, “Yes.”\n   \n      The White House immediately moved to explain the president’s comments – which could be seen as the US staking out a role in the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on October 7.   \n   \n      “The president was far away. He didn’t hear the full question. The question sounded like ‘Would you like to see more hostages released?’ He wasn’t commenting on anything else,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt said less than an hour after the president’s comment, according to the press pool.\n   \n      Earlier Friday, Hamas   in a deal brokered by the Qatari government. A number of foreign nationals were among those kidnapped by Hamas, but information about the status, location and identity of all the hostages remains scarce.\n   \n      As  , the US and its allies have been urging Israel to be strategic and clear about its goals if and when it launches a ground invasion of Gaza, warning against a prolonged occupation and placing a particular emphasis on avoiding civilian casualties, according to US and Western officials.\n   \n      During the October 7 attack, Hamas militants killed more than 1,400 people, including civilians and soldiers, according to Israeli authorities. It was the most deadly attack by militants in Israel’s 75-year history and revealed a staggering intelligence failure by the country’s security forces.\n   \n      Israel has since responded by enacting a blockade on Gaza and launching a barrage of airstrikes into the Palestinian enclave, sparking a humanitarian crisis. Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed more than 4,100 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n   \n      Biden suggested earlier Friday that Hamas’ attack on Israel was in part to derail US-backed efforts to normalize Israel-Saudi relations.\n   \n      “One of the reasons Hamas moved on Israel … they knew that I was about to sit down with the Saudis,” Biden told supporters at a campaign fundraiser in Washington, according to a pool report. \n   \n      “Guess what? The Saudis wanted to recognize Israel,” Biden said at the event, which was hosted at the home of a Democratic National Committee official in Washington. The president added that the Saudis were “about to recognize Israel.”\n   \n      The president has maintained in recent weeks that the effort to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia “is still alive” and remains crucial amid the ongoing conflict, though he has said “it’s going to take time to get done.” \n   \n      “The Saudis, and the Emiratis and other Arab nations understand that their security and stability is enhanced if there’s normalization of relations with Israel,” Biden   in an interview that aired Sunday, adding that “the direction of moving into the normalization makes sense for the Arab nations as well as Israel.” \n   \n      The  has raised concerns that it could  that could snowball into an even greater geopolitical crisis. With US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trips to multiple Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, and Biden’s  , the administration has attempted to make clear that they remain hopeful and committed to a normalization deal. \n   \n      A senior US official told CNN last month that Biden and Netanyahu discussed normalization efforts “in some depth” during a September meeting. Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed optimism that they were close to reaching a deal with Netanyahu   last month that the agreement would “change the Middle East forever” and would be a “quantum leap” in the region. \n   \n      However, when repeatedly asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins at the time what kind of concessions he would make to get the deal across the line, Netanyahu refused to answer. MBS had previously said a deal to recognize Israel would have to “ease the life of the Palestinians” though he stopped short of calling for an independent Palestinian state to be established, which has been the kingdom’s official position for decades. \n  "},

With the help of local GOP officials, a group of Trump supporters accessed and copied information from the county’s election systems in hopes of somehow proving that the election was rigged against Trump.\n   \n      She pleaded guilty Thursday to six misdemeanors – six counts of conspiracy to commit intentional interference with performance of election duties – a significant reduction from the seven felonies she initially faced. \n   \n      Fulton County prosecutors are recommending a sentence of six years probation. Powell will also be required to testify at future trials, write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia, pay nearly $9,000 in restitution and fines and turn over documents.\n   \n      Trump, a co-defendant in the Fulton County case, does not appear in Powell’s plea documents and was not mentioned at the brief plea hearing Thursday.\n   \n      After the 2020 election, Powell had peddled conspiracy theories about purported fraud and false claims about millions of votes being flipped in a global scheme against Trump that involved Venezuela and other foreign powers. \n   \n      She is now the second person in the sprawling racketeering case to plead guilty. Bail bondsman  last month pleaded guilty and agreed to testify at future trials. The other 17 defendants, including Trump, have pleaded not guilty. \n   \n      Powell admitted taking actions after the 2020 election “for the purpose of willfully tampering with electronic ballot markers and tabulating machines” and “with the intention of taking and appropriating information, data, and software, the property of Dominion Voting Systems Corporation,” according to new  .\n   \n      She is also admitting to hiring a data forensics firm and sending its employees to Coffee County so they could unlawfully access government computers with the purpose of “examining personal voter data, with knowledge that such examination was without authority,” according to the filings.\n   \n      Her attorneys had vehemently rejected prosecutors’ claims that she orchestrated the Coffee County breach. They’ve said at pretrial hearings that prosecutors are “incorrect” and that “the evidence will show that she was not the driving force behind” the incident.\n   \n      “This is a really big breakthrough for the prosecutors,” CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said on “News Central.”\n   \n      “And it’s so important to understand there is no such thing as halfway cooperation. If you’re a prosecutor, you would not enter into this deal with Sidney Powell unless you had been thoroughly convinced that A, she is telling the truth, B. she is going to be able to testify for you credibly in the way that you can put in front of a jury, and justify and see she is not going to be splitting hairs,” added Honig, a former federal prosecutor.\n   \n      Only one other Georgia defendant is mentioned by name in Thursday’s plea documents: Misty Hampton, who was the Coffee County elections supervisor during the 2020 election cycle. Powell admits to entering into a criminal conspiracy with Hampton and would be required to testify against her if she goes to trial. Hampton has pleaded not guilty to seven felonies.\n   \n      Fulton County Judge McAfee had repeatedly denied Powell’s motions to get the case tossed or at least chip away at some of the most serious accusations, including the alleged RICO violation. \n   \n      His most recent ruling came Wednesday night, when he rejected Powell’s arguments that the indictment violated her First Amendment rights.\n   \n      The last-second plea drastically changes the trial that was supposed to begin Friday, with jury selection for Powell and co-defendant Kenneth Chesebro. They both invoked their rights to a speedy trial and became the first courtroom showdown in the sprawling case – but it now appears that Chesebro will move forward on his own.\n   \n      Chesebro has pleaded not guilty to seven crimes related to his role in the fake-electors plot.\n   \n      Beyond the Georgia case, Powell is still facing legal headaches. \n   \n      She is an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal election subversion case that special counsel Jack Smith filed against Trump. That investigation has still been ongoing in recent months, and has been continuing to scrutinize Powell, CNN previously reported. She has not been charged in that case.\n   \n      Additionally, Powell is facing massive defamation lawsuits from two voting technology companies, who sued her for falsely accusing them of rigging the 2020 election against Trump. The companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic, filed the lawsuits in 2021, and the cases are still in the pre-trial discovery phase.\n   \n       \n  "},

Wendy Davis, one of the plaintiffs.\n   \n       showed vehicles with Trump flags surrounding their bus, cutting in front of it and abruptly braking as the vehicle was traveling from San Antonio to Austin on Interstate 35. There have been no criminal charges in the incident.

He specifically acknowledged that he understood and would abide by it,” Judge Arthur Engoron said in his   Friday. \n   \n      “Accordingly, issuing yet another warning is not longer appropriate; this Court is way behind the ‘warning’ stage.”\n   \n      On the second day of the trial, October 3, Engoron issued a partial gag order on all parties not to speak about any members of the court staff after Trump posted on Truth Social attacking Engoron’s clerk. The post claimed she was a “girlfriend” to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, showing a picture of the two of them together.\n   \n      The post was removed from Truth Social right after the  , but it was not erased from Trump’s campaign website, DonaldJTrump.com. \n   \n      In court, Engoron admonished the former president’s attorneys for a “blatant violation” of the gag order and suggested that violations could result in “imprisonment.”\n   \n      “I learned that the subject post was never removed from the website,” he said. “And, in fact, had been on that website for the past 17 days. I understand that it was removed late last night but only in response to an email.”\n   \n      Trump attorney Chris Kise apologized to Engoron, saying it was “inadvertent” that the post was able to live on what he called a “back page” of Trump’s campaign website.\n   \n      “It appears no one also took down the ICYMI link that’s in the campaign website in the back pages,” Kise said.\n   \n      “Truly this appears to be inadvertent,” Kise said, adding, “I certainly apologize on behalf of my clients.”\n   \n      Kise blamed it on the large machinery of the campaign and was assured the judge that Trump ordered the post removed.\n   \n      “There was no intention to evade, or circumvent, or ignore the order,” Kise added and explained nothing further has been posted on Trump’s Truth Social website.\n   \n      Kise said he got confirmation Thursday night and Friday morning that the post had been taken down and said it appears to be an issue within the campaign.\n   \n      “It’s part of the process that is built into the campaign structure as I understand it.

Their trajectory left little doubt that the projectiles were headed for Israel, the official said, a clearer assessment than the Pentagon’s initial take.\n   \n      A sustained barrage of drones and missiles targeting Israel from far outside the Gaza conflict is one of a series of worrying signs that the war risks escalating beyond the borders of the coastal enclave.\n   \n      In addition to protests at US embassies across the Middle East, US and coalition forces in Syria and Iraq have come under repeated attack over the past several days.\n   \n      On Thursday, Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi forces in Yemen and were launched “potentially towards targets in Israel.” At the briefing, Ryder said three land-attack cruise missiles and “several” drones.\n   \n      Some of the projectiles were traveling at altitudes that made them a potential risk to commercial aviation when they were intercepted, the US official said. The drones and missiles were intercepted with SM-2 surface-to-air missiles launched from the USS Carney. \n   \n      US interceptions of Houthi launches are exceedingly rare, making the timing of this incident, as tensions rise in Israel, more significant. In October 2016, the USS Mason deployed countermeasures to stop an attempted attack in the Red Sea targeting the Navy destroyer and other ships nearby. In response, the US fired sea-launched cruise missiles at Houthi radar facilities in Yemen.\n   \n      On Wednesday, one-way attack drones targeted two different US positions in Iraq, according to US Central Command. One of the attacks resulted in minor injuries. One day later, the At-Tanf garrison in Syria, which houses US and coalition forces, was targeted by two drones, which also caused minor injuries.\n   \n      Early Friday morning in Iraq, two rockets targeted the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center near the airport, which houses US military, diplomatic and civilian personnel, according to another US defense official. One rocket was intercepted by a counter-rocket system, while the second hit an empty storage facility, the official said. No one was injured as a result of the rocket attack. \n   \n      The US has not assigned attribution for any of the recent attacks in Iraq and Syria, though Iranian proxies have carried out similar drone and rocket attacks against US forces in both countries in the past.\n   \n      The US military has carried out strikes on Iranian-backed militias as a response to previous such attacks against US forces, but the Pentagon would not say anything yet about its intentions.\n   \n      “While I’m not going to forecast any potential response to these attacks, I will say that we will take all necessary actions to defend US and coalition forces against any threat,” said Ryder. “Any response, should one occur, will come at a time and a manner of our choosing.”\n  "},

It comes one day after former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. \n   \n      Chesebro pleaded guilty to one felony – conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Fulton County prosecutors recommended that he serve 5 years of probation and pay $5,000 in restitution, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee imposed that sentence at Friday’s hearing. \n   \n      Chesebro has also agreed to testify in future court proceedings.\n   \n      As part of his plea deal, Chesebro admitted that he conspired to put forward fake GOP electors in Georgia with Trump and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. Giuliani and Eastman have both pleaded not guilty in the Georgia case, and now face the prospect of Chesebro taking the witness stand against them. \n   \n      The plea came shortly after jury selection in the trial began Friday morning as planned, but was short-lived. A source familiar with the discussions said the likelihood of Chesebro taking a deal increased after  and pleaded guilty on Thursday. \n   \n      An attorney who worked to undermine the results of the 2020 election, Chesebro helped develop the Trump’s campaign’s plot to put forward unauthorized slates of GOP electors in Georgia and six other states. (In previous court filings, Chesebro’s lawyers have denied that he devised the plan.)\n   \n      He wrote   in 2020 spelling out what the pro-Trump electors should do in their respective states. In one memo Chesebro acknowledged that he was promoting a “controversial strategy” that even the Supreme Court with its conservative supermajority would “likely” reject. \n   \n      Chesebro and other Trump allies hoped then-Vice President Mike Pence would use the GOP electors to justify delaying Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory – or even throw out Biden’s lawful electors and recognize the fake GOP slates instead on January 6, 2021.\n   \n      Prosecutors said in court that Chesebro acknowledged in the plea that he “created and distributed false Electoral College documents” to Trump operatives in Georgia and other states, and that he worked “in coordination with” the Trump campaign. \n   \n      “The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents,” prosecutor Daysha Young said at the plea hearing Friday. \n   \n      Chesebro was originally charged with seven crimes, including a violation of Georgia’s RICO act, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer. Six of the seven felony charges were dropped as part of the deal. \n   \n      In addition to testifying at future trials, Chesebro agreed to write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia. \n   \n      Three defendants have now pleaded guilty in the sprawling racketeering case: Chesebro, Powell and Georgia-based bail bondsman Scott Hall.\n   \n      Powell and Hall both admitted their roles in the January 2021 breach of election systems in rural Coffee County, Georgia. As part of her plea deal, Powell agreed to testify at future trials, which could hurt Trump’s defense. Both Powell and Hall were sentenced to probation. \n   \n      Ahead of their scheduled trial, Chesebro and Powell lost several bids to get the case thrown out, including earlier this week. In a spate of pretrial rulings, McAfee rejected their arguments that Fulton County prosecutors misapplied Georgia’s RICO law and that the indictment failed to establish key elements of the crimes that have been charged.\n   \n      Both Powell and Chesebro are unindicted co-conspirators in Trump’s federal election subversion case, which was brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. Trump’s federal trial is set for March 2024 in Washington, DC.  \n   \n      Steve Sadow, lead counsel for Trump in the Georgia case, said he believes Friday’s developments will help the former president.\n   \n      “It appears to me that the guilty plea to count 15 of the Fulton County indictment was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time,” Sadow said. “However, it is very important for everyone to note that the RICO charge and every other count was dismissed. Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy.”\n   \n      Hundreds of potential jurors for the Chesebro trial were summoned to the Fulton County courthouse on Friday, where they filled out questionnaires that were designed to weed out people with conflicts-of-interest or anyone who couldn’t act impartially.\n   \n      CNN overheard a court official reading aloud from portions the jury questionnaire in a public area of the courthouse where the jury selection process was taking place. The questionnaire itself has not been made public.  \n   \n      The potential jurors were asked if they “express divisive political opinions,” if they ever attended a Trump rally or any “MAGA events,” or posted anything online about “Donald Trump’s charges.”\n   \n      They were also asked specifically if they watched the highly publicized January 6 committee hearings last year, which presented in dramatic fashion how Trump tried to overturn the election.  \n   \n      The potential jurors were also asked if they voted in any federal elections over the past 15 years. There is no indication that they were asked who they voted for, and that is never typically part of a jury questionnaire. \n   \n      At a  , Fulton County prosecutors and attorneys for Chesebro haggled over how many politically charged questions should be included. Specifically, Chesebro’s attorneys wanted to include questions that could tease out how jurors feel about “MAGA Republicans” and Trump’s attempt to “steal the election.” It’s unclear if those questions made it into the questionnaire. \n   \n      After Chesebro’s plea, McAfee returned to the jury room to dismiss the jury pool, which responded with applause and cheers \n   \n       \n  "},

An appeals court declined to put that ruling on hold, prompting Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to turn to the Supreme Court.   \n   \n      Friday, the court rejected the state’s petition.\n   \n      Justice Clarence Thomas said he would have allowed the law to go into effect. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a short statement saying he agreed with the court’s order “under the present circumstances.”  \n   \n      In his emergency application to the high court, Bailey said that the federal government does not have the legal right known as “standing” necessary to challenge the state law.   \n   \n      “State governments cutting off state resources for federal enforcement is not an injury; it is a feature of a State’s settled Tenth Amendment authority,” Bailey told the justices.  \n   \n      The 24-page decision issued in March by US District Judge Brian Wimes ruled that the law is “invalidated as unconstitutional in its entirety.”   \n   \n      “State and local law enforcement officials in Missouri may lawfully participate in joint federal task forces, assist in the investigation and enforcement of federal firearm crimes, and fully share information with the Federal Government without fear of (SAPA’s) penalties,” Wimes wrote. \n   \n      The law’s “practical effects are counterintuitive to its stated purpose,” added Wimes, a nominee of former President Barack Obama. \n   \n      “While purporting to protect citizens, SAPA exposes citizens to greater harm by interfering with the Federal Government’s ability to enforce lawfully enacted firearms regulations designed by Congress for the purpose of protecting citizens within the limits of the Constitution,” he wrote.   \n   \n      Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called the Missouri law “patently unconstitutional” in court papers opposing the emergency request.  \n   \n      “As this court has long recognized,” she wrote, “the Supremacy Clause precludes a State from nullifying federal law or interposing obstacles to the enforcement of federal law.” \n   \n      US law enforcement officials previously told CNN that federal agents have encountered a number of issues in the state since the law went into effect because local authorities were worried about potentially violating it.  \n  "},

But they have emphasized that Israel should have clear objectives when it comes to degrading Hamas and seeking to avoid a long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip.\n   \n      “Our advice to them isn’t ‘Don’t do it,’ because we completely respect their right to go after Hamas and that means going after them wherever they are,” a NATO defense minister told CNN. “So it’s not ‘Don’t do it,’ but it is ‘Think about what happens and have a strategy, not just a tactical maneuver.’ We expect Israel to act within international humanitarian law, but we understand that they’re dealing with an enemy here.”\n   \n      President Joe Biden  in an interview with “60 Minutes” last week. While he said that “taking out the extremists is a necessary requirement” for Israel, “Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don’t represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza again.”\n   \n      And on Wednesday, while in Tel Aviv, Biden warned in public remarks that wartime leadership “requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.”\n   \n      An Israeli official confirmed that these discussions with the US and other allies are taking place. A separate senior Israeli official said Friday that “Israel is well aware of the humanitarian issues and is taking steps to address it in cooperation with the US government. It’s Hamas who has turned the 2 million people of Gaza into a human shield.” \n   \n      Earlier this week, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, told CNN that Israel has “no interest” in occupying Gaza, although Israeli officials have warned the operation there will be lengthy. \n   \n      Hamas is also believed to be holding over 200 hostages, who could be endangered if Israel invades. The group  , a mother and her daughter, on Friday.\n   \n      US officials don’t yet have a clear sense for Israel’s intentions in Gaza and believe it will be difficult for Hamas to be eradicated entirely.\n   \n      At least publicly, Israeli officials have articulated their plans only in broad strokes, saying that the goal is to eliminate Hamas and its infrastructure.\n   \n      “Our responsibility now is to enter Gaza, go to the places where Hamas organizes, operates, plans and launches,” Israel Defense Forces Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi said Sunday, according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. “To hit them severely everywhere, every commander, every operative, and to destroy infrastructure. In one word – to win.”\n   \n      In 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu set out to debilitate Hamas with the last ground invasion into Gaza. While that war dealt Hamas a significant blow, it was a huge challenge, and Israel hasn’t attempted another incursion since.\n   \n      There is also a rising concern that a ground invasion could further inflame tensions in the region, officials explained, which heightened after a   that Israel and Hamas have blamed on each other. The US has assessed that Israel was not responsible but has yet to conclusively identify a culprit.\n   \n        across the Arab world in the wake of the hospital explosion, and a large-scale and seemingly indiscriminate Israeli ground incursion into Gaza could fuel further unrest, US and Middle Eastern officials told CNN. \n   \n      US troops   multiple times in recent days in Iraq and Syria, with drones and rockets targeting coalition bases there. And Hezbollah – the Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon – has threatened further action if Israeli boots step into Gaza. \n   \n      “I think we all understand the importance of the information warfare spare,” said one source familiar with US intelligence. “Whatever they do, it needs to be thoughtful and deliberate.”\n   \n      US officials also fear that a particularly bloody assault on Gaza could risk drawing Hezbollah, to the north, or even Iran into the conflict. Right now, multiple officials familiar with US and Western intelligence say, it appears that neither Tehran nor Hezbollah are particularly keen to intervene directly. But if there is a parade of images of Palestinians suffering under an Israeli assault, their domestic politics could shift.\n   \n      A senior US official told CNN that among the benefits of Biden’s trip to Israel this week was that it “buys us some time” when it comes to a potential Israeli ground incursion. It was generally understood before the trip that Israel would not escalate in Gaza while Biden was visiting, the official said. \n   \n      The official added that the longer the Israelis hold off on this kind of military operation the better, because it allows Israel to plan more strategically and not respond as emotionally to the horrors of October 7.\n   \n      Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence analyst specializing in the region, told CNN that “the good news is they (Israel forces) have taken the time. They didn’t go immediately and launch a ground operation the next day. I think the president deserves some credit for buying time.”\n   \n      But Panikoff added that any kind of ground operation won’t be quick or easy, because urban warfare in such a densely populated area is a unique challenge – especially in a place where Hamas is embedded with the civilian population.\n   \n      “I don’t think that necessarily the goal (of Biden’s trip) was to prevent a full-scale invasion,” he said. “I think the goal was to show clear support (and) to understand Israel’s strategy of what comes after an invasion if Israel is successful in decimating Hamas. What’s the plan for governance in the Gaza Strip?”\n  "},

We’re going to continue to do so. We have not yet launched a national campaign, we have launched a successful Iowa strategy,” Scott told donors. “We’ll continue to play that out for the next several weeks and couple of months.” \n   \n      The call came just days after the super PAC supporting his campaign canceled the remainder of its TV and digital ad reservations\n   \n      Scott campaign senior adviser Zac Moffatt said on the call that the campaign plans to bolster its Iowa ground game with additional staffing and increased visits to the state in the coming weeks. \n   \n      “You’re gonna see us put more and more of an emphasis, because we know that we need to do well in Iowa to have a springboard to everything else. So you’ll get to see us put more and more of an emphasis with our resources and our staffing to ensure that we’re in Iowa fighting every single day for every vote we can,” Moffatt said. “And the reason we’re doing that is that we feel like Iowa is still not only not settled, but there’s a massive opportunity there.” \n   \n      The day after the call, Scott embarked on a five-day bus tour of Iowa, even as his path to the nomination appears murkier than ever. Earlier this week, Trust in the Mission PAC, the super PAC supporting Scott’s campaign,   the remainder of its $40 million in TV and digital ad reservations, citing the challenges of “breaking through” to voters. The announcement came a day after federal filings showed the Scott campaign spent $12.4 million during the third quarter but only raised $4.6 million in that same time period, putting a dent in his once-formidable advantage in cash reserves. \n   \n      Scott told CNN’s Abby Phillip on Thursday he supports the decision by the super PAC to pull its ad buys and dismissed questions about the health of his campaign.\n   \n       “I don’t run the super PAC. So I can’t tell you exactly what that memo meant, but what I can tell you is that it focuses on is reserving our resources until later in the campaign so that as we get close to the January 15, date of the Iowa caucus, we have the resources to spend effectively,” Scott said. “Breaking through this current news cycle seems to be impossible. So any alternative to the former president will not have actual opportunity to showcase why they should be the alternative.”\n   \n      When asked if he’s considering dropping out of the race given the context laid out in the memo, Scott said he plans to keep running. \n   \n      “Oh, of course not,” Scott said. “We believe that America’s ready for an optimistic positive messenger who is anchored in consistently conservative values.”\n   \n       Scott’s efforts to establish his viability are further complicated by a struggle to make up ground in the polls in comparison to rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. In a national Fox News poll of potential Republican primary voters released last week, Scott earned 1% support. Scott received 3% in a September Fox survey. Scott has not yet met the polling threshold to qualify for the November debate, which mandates candidates receive 4% support in two national polls or one national poll and two early state polls. He has surpassed the donor requirements set by the Republican party, a campaign spokesperson told CNN. \n   \n      A South Carolina-based Republican strategist supporting Scott’s campaign said the cancellation by the PAC gives the South Carolina senator a chance to take stock of the primary landscape. \n   \n      “I think the memo on Monday, it was certainly a chance to sort of reset, take a deep breath and get ready for this final lap,” the strategist said. \n   \n      Scott’s Iowa bus tour is part of an effort by the campaign to raise his popularity in the state, with the hope that a strong showing in the caucuses in January can spark some momentum and propel him into viability. The visit to the Hawkeye State for this weekend’s tour will be his third trip there in as many weeks, and the trips are supplemented by a bevy of TV ads from his campaign targeting Iowa voters. As of Friday, Scott’s campaign has spent $11.6 million on TV ads, more than any other campaign so far. More than half of those ad buys have been in Iowa, according to data from the ad tracking firm AdImpact. \n   \n      Scott often leans into his Christian faith and his background to appeal to the significant evangelical coalition among Iowa Republicans, frequently quoting scripture at campaign stops. \n   \n      Scott campaign pollster Erik Iverson presented internal polling data to donors on Thursday’s call to support the campaign’s focus on evangelical voters, whose support he said remains up for grabs. \n   \n      “Traditionally in Iowa, that evangelical lane plays a very outsized level of importance,” Iverson said. “Sort of remarkably, that lane is completely unfilled right now. It’s completely wide open.”\n   \n      On the call with donors Thursday, Moffatt said he believes the campaign has enough time to pick up support as more voters make up their minds. \n   \n      “If you look at the history of prior presidential races, moderates jump out to an early lead, they consolidate quickly and they get all this hope and change that’s coming into September, October, and then they crash into the winter,” Moffat said on the call. “I will say, winter is coming as conservatives and as the primary electorate starts to pay attention. You’re going to see big moves, and it always ends badly for the people who started early who haven’t really been focused on yet.”\n   \n      Bev Lessman, a Republican voter and small business owner from Sioux City, Iowa, is one of those voters still waiting to decide. She said she likes Scott, and attended an event he held in Le Mars, Iowa, in August. She’s currently undecided, but is considering Scott, Haley, DeSantis and Trump. To her, electability is a crucial factor when considering who to support. But all things being equal, if she had to vote today, she would want to see Scott on the GOP ticket – just not on the top line. \n   \n      “I would actually vote for Nikki Haley and Tim Scott would be a great vice president,” she said. \n   \n      When he first launched his campaign in May, Scott was viewed by many Republicans as one of a handful of White House hopefuls who could offer a viable threat to Trump in the primary. His personal narrative –  a Black man who grew up in poverty, was raised by a single mother in South Carolina and has since risen to the US Senate – made him appealing to a wide group of voters, and his substantial war chest and connections to donors gave him stature in a crowded field. \n   \n      But in the intervening months, other candidates, like fellow South Carolinian Haley, have gained some ground, while Scott has yet to have his moment. And as the primary calendar inches closer, some Republicans are anxiously hoping some candidates will fade away and allow support to build around the strongest alternative to Trump, who received 59% in the Fox poll of Republican primary voters releases earlier this month. At the moment, it’s unclear if Scott can be that candidate. \n   \n      “I think if Donald Trump wasn’t in this race, it would be a very different discussion. But Trump casts such a large shadow over the rest of the Republican field, that it has stifled an ability for people to get traction,” South Carolina conservative political strategist Dave Wilson told CNN. \n   \n      “I think the only place where I really see traction taking hold, ironically, is with Nikki Haley. Her numbers continue to tick up and up and up,” he added. \n   \n      Haley’s ascent has increased the pressure on Scott to either prove he can take on the former president or step aside to make room for other candidates. Last week, Washington Post columnist George Will called on Scott to drop out of the race and support Haley, an awkward proposal given that Will’s wife, Mari, is an adviser to Scott’s campaign. The opinion piece came on the heels of former Texas Rep. Will Hurd dropping out of the race and backing Haley earlier this month. \n   \n      When asked by CNN about Will’s piece after an event last week, Scott laughed off the call to drop out, joking “I guess this just proves there are mixed marriages,” and said he plans to stay in the race. \n   \n      Still, Scott has adopted a sharper, more aggressive rhetorical style in recent weeks and has shown a new willingness to attack rivals like Haley and DeSantis directly. Scott has used the aftermath of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel to harshly condemn President Joe Biden, who he said has “blood on his hands” following the attacks, as well as his Republican rivals. During a recent speech in Washington, DC, focused on Israel, he hit DeSantis and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for their “weakness and confusion” on foreign policy issues. And at a foreign policy panel at Georgetown University on Monday, Scott criticized Haley for saying not all Palestinians are antisemitic, part of an argument against accepting refugees from Gaza into the US. He falsely suggested Haley supports accepting refugees, insinuating she held the position “to be popular.” \n   \n      “How do we make sure that our nation remains the greatest nation on God’s green earth if we have no ability to discern who’s coming our country? I can’t figure that out. If I can’t figure that out, as commander in chief, I have a responsibility to take a leap back and say, not on my watch,” Scott said. “Our nation is just too important for me to make bad decisions under pressure because I want to be popular. That doesn’t work for me.”\n   \n      For Scott, harsh attacks on rival candidates can at times bristle against his typically optimistic campaign message. Yet he says efforts to distinguish himself from other candidates are focused on policy differences in part to preserve the Republican nominee’s chances to defeat Biden in the general election, whomever that may be. \n   \n      “My quest has always been to be an optimist, to be positive. I’m positive that showing the contrast between me and my opponents is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Scott quipped in an interview with the “Ruthless” podcast released Thursday. “To the extent that we focus on those contrasts, I’m not going to make it personal.”\n   \n      “I don’t want to poison the well so much so that everything that I say is going to be on a Democrat campaign ad,” he added.\n  "},

The actions draw a stark contrast with the Trump administration, which tried to limit some of these forgiveness programs and  . \n   \n      But Biden’s Republican critics say that at least some of his debt relief actions are illegal and are an  .\n   \n      Nearly $42 billion of federal student loan debt has been canceled for almost 855,000 borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans – largely due to the Biden administration’s effort to recount borrowers’ past payments and fix what officials have called  \n   \n      Borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, which have been available in some form since 1993, are generally eligible for debt discharges after making qualifying payments for at least 20 years. The plans lower monthly payments by tying them to a borrower’s income and family size.\n   \n      But the Department of Education has historically had trouble tracking borrowers’ payments. \n   \n      Last year, the   that the department do more to ensure that borrowers receive the forgiveness they are entitled to, after it found that there were thousands of loans still in repayment that could already be eligible for forgiveness. \n   \n      “These are borrowers getting discharges that they should have received under programs authorized by Congress if they’d been operated as they should have over decades,” a Department of Education official said to CNN in an emailed statement. \n   \n      Generally, the one-time recount will give borrowers credit toward forgiveness for any months in which they made payments regardless of what repayment plan they were enrolled in at the time,  . The recount especially helps borrowers who may have been inappropriately steered by their student loan servicing company into a long-term forbearance, a period in which they stopped making payments. \n   \n      The one-time account adjustment effort was first announced by the Biden administration in April 2022 – but the cancellations did not begin until this year.\n   \n      The administration   in student loan debt due to the changes just two weeks after the Supreme Court knocked down Biden’s signature loan forgiveness program – drawing some skepticism about whether the move was legal. \n   \n      “The Biden administration is trampling the rule of law, hurting borrowers, and abusing taxpayers to chase headlines,” Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said in a statement at the time.\n   \n      “Today’s celebration of counting no payments as payments is just the latest example of the ongoing delusion at the White House,” she added. \n   \n      The Biden administration is facing at least one lawsuit over the account adjustments, filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance on behalf of the conservative groups Cato Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The plaintiffs recently   after the   by a federal judge in Michigan, who ruled that they did not have standing to bring the complaint. \n   \n      Lawyers for the Biden administration have not yet been required to respond to the complaint and specify the legal authority relied on to cancel billions of dollars of student loan debt by adjusting past payments.\n   \n      “There are several sources of authority that the department may be relying on, given its expansive authority over the federal student loan program generally and the income-driven repayment plans in particular,” said Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center and director of its Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.\n   \n      Even if the lawsuit succeeds, Shafroth said it would surprise her if the court’s decision would result in reversing the debt relief that has already occurred. \n   \n      Nearly $51 billion of student loan debt has been canceled for 715,000 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program since Biden took office. \n   \n      The PSLF program cancels outstanding federal student loan debt for public-sector workers who have made 120 qualifying monthly student loan payments, or about 10 years’ worth of payments.  A variety of government and nonprofit workers – including teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors, and government lawyers – may qualify for the program. \n   \n      The program was created by Congress in 2007 but was plagued with administrative problems before Biden took office.\n   \n      In 2021,  , expanding eligibility so that some borrowers could retroactively receive credit for past payments that did not otherwise qualify for PSLF.\n   \n        of the borrowers who have been granted debt relief by the PSLF program qualified because of Biden’s temporary waiver.\n   \n      The temporary benefits ended in October 2022. But the Department of Education has since conducted an executive rulemaking process to permanently change some of the qualifying restrictions of the PSLF program. The changes allow borrowers to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum, for example. Those changes went into effect in July.\n   \n      The Biden administration has canceled $22.5 billion of student loan debt for more than 1.3 million borrowers through an existing program known as borrower defense to repayment, which delivers student debt relief to people who were defrauded by their college.\n   \n      Most recently, $37 million was canceled for more than 1,200 borrowers   because the government found that the for-profit school misled students about job prospects.\n   \n      The borrower defense program was created by Congress decades ago but was rarely used until Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit network of schools, collapsed in 2015. \n   \n      Under Biden, the Department of Education has made progress in whittling down  that built up during the Trump administration.\n   \n      At one point, more than 200,000 borrower defense claims were pending as former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made efforts to limit the program. Those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. \n   \n      The Biden administration has also made it easier for disabled borrowers to receive the debt relief to which they are entitled. Nearly 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability have received $11.7 billion in student loan forgiveness since 2021. \n   \n      Previously, borrowers were required to provide documentation from a physician, the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs to show that they qualified for debt relief. \n   \n      But the Biden administration changed the rule so that the Department of Education can provide automatic discharges for disabled borrowers who are identified through administrative data matching with the Social Security Administration – without the borrowers submitting paperwork.\n  "},

He still has a pending motion to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, but the case now appears on track for an unprecedented trial this month.\n   \n      A post-Civil War   says US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from future office if they “engaged in insurrection” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. But the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban, and it has been applied only twice since the 1800s.\n   \n      A liberal watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed the Colorado case on behalf of six Republican and unaffiliated voters. The judge is scheduled to   beginning October 30 to decide a series of novel legal questions about how the 14th Amendment could apply to Trump.\n   \n      In a  , Wallace rejected many of Trump’s arguments that the case was procedurally flawed and should be shut down. She said the key question of whether Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has the power to block Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment “is a pivotal issue and one best reserved for trial.”\n   \n      Wallace also swatted away arguments from the Colorado GOP that state law gives the party, not election officials, ultimate say on which candidates appear on the ballot.\n   \n      “If the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency,” she wrote. “Such an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.”\n   \n      Wallace also cited a   from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, when he was a Denver-based appeals judge, which said states have the power to “exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” She cited this while rejecting Trump’s claim that Colorado’s ballot access laws don’t give state officials any authority to disqualify him based on federal constitutional considerations.\n   \n      Trump already   to throw out the case on free-speech grounds.\n   \n      The current GOP front-runner, Trump denies wrongdoing regarding January 6 and has pleaded not guilty to   and   charges stemming from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His campaign has said these lawsuits are pushing an “absurd conspiracy theory” and the challengers are “stretching the law beyond recognition.”\n   \n      In a statement on Saturday, the Trump campaign criticized Wallace and her rulings, saying she “got it wrong.” \n   \n      “She is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed – whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the U.S. Supreme Court,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said. “To keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.”\n   \n      The 14th Amendment challenges in Colorado and other key states face an uphill climb, with many legal hurdles to clear before Trump would be disqualified from running for the presidency. Trump is sure to appeal any decision to strip him from the ballot, which means the Supreme Court and its conservative supermajority might get the final say.\n   \n      In recent months, a growing and politically diverse array of legal scholars   behind the idea that Trump is disqualified under the “insurrectionist ban.” The bipartisan House committee that investigated the January 6 attack   last year that Trump be barred from holding future office under the 14th Amendment.\n   \n      The Colorado challengers recently revealed in a court filing that they want to depose Trump before trial.

Jim Jordan out of the race, the latest sign of the chaos and divisions that have engulfed the majority party and left the chamber in a state of paralysis. \n   \n      The stage is now set for new speaker hopefuls to emerge – and a number of Republicans jumped into the race shortly after Jordan’s exit. It is increasingly uncertain, however, whether any lawmaker can get the 217 votes needed to win the gavel while Republicans control such a narrow majority. Republicans are expected to hold a candidate forum Monday evening.  \n   \n      The House remains effectively frozen as long as there is no elected speaker. The paralysis has created a perilous situation as Congress faces the threat of a government shutdown next month and conflict unfolds abroad. The battle for the speakership has now dragged on for more than two weeks with no end in sight. \n   \n      In a dramatic turn of events, the House GOP conference voted by secret ballot on Friday to drop  as their speaker designee after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day. \n   \n      Jordan’s failure to win the gavel highlighted the limits of former President Donald Trump’s influence in the speaker’s race after he endorsed Jordan. \n   \n      Speaking to reporters after the vote to push him out, Jordan said, “We need to come together and figure out who our speaker is going to be,” and said he told the conference, “It was an honor to be their speaker designee.” \n   \n      The move by Republicans against Jordan came after three failed floor votes for his speaker bid and vows from the Ohio Republican to remain in the race despite mounting opposition against him.\n   \n      In Friday’s floor vote, 25 House Republicans voted against Jordan – a higher number than in the two prior votes and far more than the handful of defectors Jordan could afford to lose and still win the gavel given the GOP’s narrow majority. \n   \n      A number of Republicans left Friday’s closed-door meeting sounding more confused than ever about the path forward and who is best to lead them. Many expressed frustration and some called for reflection after the collapse of Jordan’s speakership bid. “We’re back to square one,” South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson said. \n   \n      The field of potential candidates seeking to succeed McCarthy as the next speaker is already shaping up to be crowded and more are likely to announce in the coming days. \n   \n      Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip, is making calls to run, according to two sources. And McCarthy is backing him for speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost for his candidacy. McCarthy did not publicly endorse a candidate when Jordan and Scalise vied for the nomination.\n   \n      Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told CNN on Friday that “yes” he plans to run for speaker and said he’ll work “hard” to get people on his side. A spokesman for Rep. Jack Bergman of Michigan, meanwhile, told CNN he is also running for the role.\n   \n      Now that the field is wide open, Georgia Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week, but quickly dropped out and then supported Jordan, is running again, his spokesperson told CNN.\n   \n      Rep.  , the interim House speaker, said that Republicans will gather Monday for a candidate forum. “We need space and time for candidates to talk to other members,” he said. \n   \n      When the vote count against Jordan  , there were three new GOP votes in opposition – Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Tom Kean of New Jersey and Marc Molinaro of New York. \n   \n      Kean said in a statement explaining his position, “it has become evident that Chairman Jordan does not and will not have the votes to become Speaker.”\n   \n      Some Republicans who have oppose Jordan decried what they described as a pressure campaign against them by allies of the Ohio Republican. And several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s speakership bid have said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes. Jordan  \n   \n      A closed-door House GOP conference  , multiple sources told CNN. Some members encouraged Jordan to drop out of the race. There was also an emotional discussion over the threats some Jordan holdouts are facing. Later, members leaving the meeting described it as an airing of grievances with tensions running high.\n   \n      Some Republicans looking for a way to break the impasse have suggested expanding the powers of McHenry – a controversial move that would put the House even further into uncharted territory. But there is widespread opposition within the Republican conference to the idea.  \n   \n       \n  "},

But it’s a hard one to market. You’ret going to have to say that Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, all of this is going to be much stronger at the end. It doesn’t affect people over 55. And even if you’re 23 years old, you have the right to stay on Medicare, right?”  \n   \n      “He wants to save Medicare,” Trump added a week later on Fox and Friends.  \n   \n      And despite his recent very similar attacks on DeSantis, Trump argued in 2012 on CNBC that Democrats were engaging in demagoguery.  \n   \n      “These things are gonna have to come out. And you know, unfortunately, you talk about demagogue, they’re demagoguing to a point where it’s almost like Medicare - everything’s gonna be taken away from you,” said Trump. “You’re gonna be destroyed, you’re gonna live in the streets. That’s hard to counter, but the Republicans are gonna have to counter it.” \n   \n      “I would have maybe done some of the things they did, but I would’ve done it after the election,” Trump said. “Not before the election.

Jim Jordan prolifically pushed false stolen election rhetoric.  \n   \n      After then-President Donald Trump lost the election to Joe Biden, Jordan urged Trump not to concede, spread conspiracy theories, supported lawsuits attempting to disqualify the legitimate results and discussed plans to object to the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021.  \n   \n      He would later be applauded by Trump in his speech to supporters on January 6, 2021,   the Ohio Republican one of the “great ones” for his efforts.   \n   \n      Though Trump lost, Jordan   people to “get to the bottom of what actually happened on election day.”  \n   \n      He would later claim in  , “I’ve never said this election was stolen, all I’ve said is, ‘Let’s check it out.’”   \n   \n      But a CNN KFile review of his public comments and his frequent media appearances show Jordan repeatedly suggested just that. One hundred forty-seven Republicans objected to the election results on January 6, 2021, but Jordan, with his constant television and radio appearances, was among the most vocal.  \n   \n       and  , Jordan suggested Trump could not have lost because Republicans picked up seats in the House of Representatives that cycle and Trump got more votes than in 2016.  \n   \n      “Something doesn’t feel right here,” Jordan said in one appearance on Hannity, repeating a frequent remark of his. “Our president got 9 million more votes this time than he did four years ago, and yet he comes up short,” Jordan  .  \n   \n      In the lead up to the election, Jordan baselessly suggested   that Democrats were orchestrating a plan to steal the election – implying that Covid-19 rule changes for voting in states were part of a Democratic plot. \n   \n      “Democrats are trying to steal the election, after the election,” Jordan wrote in one October 2020  , criticizing a decision from the Supreme Court allowing mail-in ballots received up to three days after Election Day in Pennsylvania to be counted. \n   \n      Following Trump’s loss, Jordan, as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee,  to the committee’s chairperson demanding a hearing into alleged fraud in the 2020 election.   \n   \n      “We urge you to immediately convene hearings to examine the integrity of the 2020 election amid troubling reports of irregularities and improprieties,” Jordan wrote in a November 18 letter.  \n   \n      “Jim Jordan was deeply involved in Donald Trump’s antidemocratic efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Thomas Joscelyn, one of the authors of the final report from the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol told CNN. “Jordan also helped organize congressional opposition to counting Biden’s certified electoral votes. None of Jordan’s efforts were rooted in legitimate objections. He simply sought to keep Donald Trump in power, contrary to the will of the American people.” \n   \n      Reached by CNN for comment, Russell Dye, a spokesman for Jordan, said the congressman was doing normal oversight. \n   \n      “Mr. Jordan was doing his constitutional duty by conducting oversight of the 2020 election and objected to certain states much like the Democrats did when President Trump’s electoral votes were being counted.”  \n   \n      A   of Democrats objected to the counting of electoral votes in 2017, but the effort was quickly shot down.  \n   \n      In early December 2020, Jordan voiced support for a  to block the results in that state. The lawsuit   by the Supreme Court.  \n   \n      “I hope it does get to the Supreme Court,” Jordan  . “I hope we can get to the answer to this.”  \n   \n      He later voiced support for a Texas  by Attorney General Ken Paxton to invalidate results in swing states won by Biden – which would have effectively thrown the election to Trump. The lawsuit   by the Supreme Court. \n   \n      “Yeah, regarding a number of states, I think that’s great,” Jordan   on Newsmax. “I think, you know, some, uh, uh, trending on Twitter was God bless Texas.” \n   \n      In media appearances, Jordan suggested Trump could not have lost the 2020 election. \n   \n      “I don’t know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn’t actually win this thing based on all the things you see,” Jordan   during an appearance on Fox News radio on December 9, 2020.   \n   \n      On the same program, he also made the argument that because some Americans believe the election was rigged “we should do everything we can to get to the bottom of” their allegations. \n   \n      Just a day earlier, speaking on Newsmax, Jordan said Trump should not concede the election. \n   \n      “He should not concede. Everyone knows instinctively, everyone knows there are problems with this election,” Jordan said. \n   \n      In the run-up to the Georgia Senate runoff elections in January, Jordan was asked by a radio host how they could beat Democratic attempts to “steal” the election with early and mail in voting. Jordan said Republicans would need to out vote it overwhelming.  \n   \n      “Sometimes you gotta beat the referee,” Jordan   on December 14. “We’re gonna have to run a great election. We’re gonna have to have even more people there when they’re counting votes, overseeing what they’re doing. Not let ‘em kick you out of the room, not let ‘em do certain things that they did in some of these key states around the country a month and a half ago.” \n   \n      Frequent  ,   claims of Republican poll watchers being obstructed circulated after the 2020 election among Republicans on social media. \n   \n      Later, on January 5, 2021, Jordan   a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows outlining a legal theory that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to stand in the way of the certification of the 2020 election. \n   \n      Jordan would frequently call for a “debate” on January 6, 2021, on the House floor in comments   by Just Security, a website focusing on reporting and analysis of national security law and policy.  \n   \n      “Jordan’s appearances on right-wing and far right-wing news outlets and his social media account were a near constant drumbeat of disinformation up until January 6th,” said Ryan Goodman, the editor of Just Security and a law professor at New York University in a message to CNN. On the 6th, Jordan again baselessly suggested that Trump won the election in a speech on the House floor just before rioting would break in the Capitol, adjourning the session. \n   \n      “Got 11 million more votes than he did in 2016 and House Republicans won 27 of 27 toss-up races, but somehow the guy who never left his house wins the election?” Jordan  . \n   \n      Though Trump did win 11 million more votes than in 2016, Biden won 81 million votes – 15 million more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.  \n   \n      On numerous occasions, Jordan also shared conspiracies that were debunked about fraud in the 2020 election. \n   \n      In early December 2020, Jordan   on Newsmax that a video showed election workers in Georgia committing fraud.  \n   \n      “And now we have this video. Now we have this. So why not get to the bottom of all this?,” Jordan said.  \n   \n      In fact, the    fraud and suggestions of it were condemned by Republican officials in the state who  .  \n   \n      On November 9, 2020, Jordan tweeted a false claim that Democrats excluded poll watchers.  \n   \n      “Why did Pennsylvania Democrats exclude poll watchers during the vote count?” he  , when even Trump’s own attorneys later admitted this  . \n   \n      In one appearance on Fox News, Jordan claimed dead people were registering to vote and that it warranted further investigation. \n   \n      “There are some states where that, that they not only voted while they were dead,” Jordan said. “They registered, they asked for an absentee ballot while they were dead, and they registered while they were dead.” \n   \n      “Now, it’s not a big enough number to overturn the results, but it happened,” he added. “And it’s, it’s sort of like where you see some, some problems. Might there be more. It’s certainly worth investigating when you’re talking about the integrity of the American election.”\n   \n      Claims of dead people voting have been    . \n  "},

Ron DeSantis, his presidential campaign and a super PAC backing him are inaccurately depicting a comment Republican rival Nikki Haley made on CNN on Sunday about the people of  . \n   \n      The DeSantis camp has been claiming this week that Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations and governor of South Carolina, said in a   that the US should take in refugees from Gaza – the Palestinian territory controlled by Hamas, the Islamist group that perpetrated the terrorist attacks that killed more than 1,400 people in Israel this month.\n   \n      On Monday, the pro-DeSantis super PAC, Never Back Down,   of Haley’s remarks and claimed the video showed Haley arguing in favor of “bringing Gaza refugees to America.” The same day, the DeSantis campaign   a video of DeSantis responding to what the campaign claimed was “Nikki Haley wanting to import Gazan refugees to the U.S.” On Tuesday, DeSantis   in a Fox interview that Haley had been speaking on CNN about bringing people from Gaza to the US.\n   \n      All of these claims are wrong.\n   \n       :  \n   \n      Rather, Haley was   by CNN anchor Jake Tapper for her thoughts about DeSantis having said that while the people of Gaza are not all Hamas, “they are all antisemitic” and “none of them” believes Israel has the right to exist. Haley responded that many Gazans don’t want to be ruled by Hamas, just as many Iranians oppose the regime that governs them, and the US should continue to distinguish between terrorists and civilians. \n   \n      She did not say the US should take in any of these Gaza civilians as refugees. And in subsequent remarks, Haley has expressed firm opposition to the US accepting refugees from Gaza. She   on Fox on Tuesday that “Hamas-sympathizing” Middle Eastern countries should take in these refugees instead.\n   \n      You can read the full transcript of Haley’s Sunday exchange with Tapper  . The exchange was not about whether the US should accept refugees from Gaza. \n   \n      Here’s what actually happened. \n   \n      Tapper noted that a high proportion of Gaza residents are children and asked Haley if she thinks “the US, Israel, Egypt needs to be doing more to help these innocent Palestinian civilians get out of harm’s way.” Haley said, “You know what, we should care about the Palestinian citizens, especially the innocent ones, because they didn’t ask for this.” \n   \n      But then she continued: “But where are the Arab countries? Where are they? Where is Qatar? Where is Lebanon? Where is Jordan? Where is Egypt? Do you know we give Egypt over a billion dollars a year? Why aren’t they opening the gates? Why aren’t they taking the Palestinians? You know why? Because they know they can’t vet them, and they don’t want Hamas in their neighborhood. So why would Israel want them in their neighborhood?”\n   \n      After Haley completed her answer, Tapper asked her to listen to a clip of DeSantis’ assertions in Iowa on Saturday that not all Gazans are Hamas but that all are antisemitic and none thinks Israel has the right to exist. DeSantis made these claims   that the US should not accept refugees from Gaza, but CNN did not play the portion of his comments about refugees to Haley during the interview; Tapper was specifically asking Haley for her thoughts on how DeSantis characterized Gazans’ beliefs. \n   \n      Before he got to his question, Tapper read out some results from a  , which found, among other things, that 50% of Gazans want Hamas to “stop calling for Israel’s destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the  .” Tapper then said: “So I’m not really certain that Governor DeSantis has a real read on the difference between Hamas and the people of Gaza. What was your response when you heard what Governor DeSantis said?” \n   \n      Haley responded by invoking her two-year tenure as US ambassador to the UN in 2017 and 2018, when she said many Gazans indeed opposed Hamas.\n   \n      “I dealt with this every day for two years. And what I can tell you is, you have to realize that, whether we’re talking about Gazans and Palestinians, all of them don’t – you’ve got half of them at the time that I was there didn’t want to be under Hamas’ rule. They didn’t want to have terrorists overseeing them. They knew that they were living a terrible life because of Hamas. You had the other half that supported Hamas and wanted to be a part of that. We see that with Iran too. The Iranian people don’t want to be under that Iranian regime. They don’t – we saw what happened to  . We saw how they treat them,” Haley said.\n   \n      Haley continued: “There are so many of these people who want to be free from this terrorist rule. They want to be free from all of that. And America’s always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists. And that’s what we have to do. But right now, we can never take our eyes off of the terrorists. I mean, what Hamas did was beyond thuggish, brutal, and sick.” \n   \n      Again, nowhere did Haley say that the US should take in Gazans as refugees.\n   \n      The DeSantis camp has emphasized Haley’s comment that “America’s always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from terrorists.” \n   \n      DeSantis   in a Fox interview on Tuesday: “Over the weekend, she was taking issue with what I said, saying that you can separate someone who’s Hamas in Gaza with somebody who’s more of a freedom-lover. So why would she be talking about that we can vet these people if she wasn’t saying that they should come to this country? We would have no role in vetting them unless you’re bringing them to this country.” \n   \n      But Haley did not use the word “vet” on CNN in the context of the US; when she did use the word, she was talking about how Middle Eastern countries   vet refugees from Gaza. And it’s a baseless leap to claim that Haley was talking about refugees when she spoke of how the US should distinguish terrorists from Hamas-opposing civilians.\n   \n      There are numerous possible reasons other than refugee policy that someone could find it important for the US government to understand the beliefs of Gaza’s population. For example, Gazans’ views about Hamas could be pertinent to the durability of Hamas’ control over Gaza. Gazans’ views could also affect the willingness of a member of Congress or a president to authorize humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, or affect their positions on Israel’s military actions.\n   \n      In a   attacking Haley over her comments on CNN, the pro-DeSantis super PAC used a question mark that appeared to slightly hedge its claim about what Haley was saying – putting text over the video of Haley’s remarks that reads, “NIKKI HALEY ON GAZA REFUGEES?” \n   \n      But the ad – which juxtaposes some of Haley’s words with a clip of DeSantis expressing opposition to the US taking refugees from Gaza – is misleading nonetheless. A single question mark is not nearly sufficient to explain that these Haley comments never even mentioned the US taking in refugees.\n   \n      In a Wednesday email, a spokesperson for the super PAC repeated DeSantis’ argument that Haley’s comment about how America needs to “separate civilians from terrorists” was about refugees. The spokesperson also said, “DeSantis said Gazans are antisemitic and do not believe in Israel’s right to exist BECAUSE he was arguing against bringing Gaza refugees to the U.S. So it is fair to view Haley’s rejection of DeSantis’ statements in that context.” And the spokesperson criticized Haley’s past positions on US refugee policy.\n  "},

(Note: CNN’s photo editors were unable to find a photo of Biden and Meir standing together.)\n   \n       \n   \n       \n   \n      He told the same story earlier in the day, although he was off on a key detail. Speaking before he   there, he said the meeting took place “just before the Six-Day War,” which occurred in 1967, before Meir was prime minister and before Biden was a senator.\n   \n      But the ending of the story is always essentially the same.

Steve Scalise, failed in the first round of voting to replace McCarthy to get a majority among Republicans.   to wheel and deal to get the position. He’ll remain as House majority leader.\n   \n      ►  , a founding member of the hardline Freedom Caucus, couldn’t unite the party in   despite a ruthless pressure campaign placed on Republicans by the right-wing media machine and personal lobbying by Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n   \n      Jordan could call for another vote, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not receding. With the clock ticking on that short-term funding bill (the government will continue operating until November 17), there appears to be growing momentum to give some additional power to the placeholder,  , whose chief qualification may be that he says he has no real interest in the job of House speaker.\n   \n      When McCarthy got the boot, McHenry was elevated to become the powerless temporary speaker – known as speaker pro tempore – able to keep the House in session but not to pass any legislation.\n   \n      Democrats, after refusing to rescue McCarthy from the fringe of his own Republican conference, could now buy in to giving temporary power to open the House and deal with that spending bill.\n   \n      The mechanism for such an arrangement could be a simple resolution giving McHenry the temporary power to move appropriations legislation.\n   \n      “I think it’s imperative that we empower Patrick McHenry to serve, at least for the time being, in that speaker role, so that he can get the House moving again on critical issues including obviously needed additional financial support for Israel,” Rep. Mike Lawler, the New York Republican who cast his vote for McCarthy instead of Jordan in both rounds, told CNN’s Manu Raju after Jordan’s second defeat.\n   \n      The Hill notes that three former Republican House speakers – former Reps. Newt Gingrich, John Boehner and Paul Ryan – all seemed to endorse the idea of temporarily elevating McHenry.\n   \n      “America does not have the luxury to stand by and allow a handful of destructive Republicans – or even the legitimate ambitions of good people – to keep the system from working,”   on his website, suggesting that if no permanent speaker can be selected in the next few days, McHenry should be elevated until the new year.\n   \n      Jordan is among the Republicans fighting the idea and who say it would essentially be a “coalition government” rather than a Republican speaker – although McHenry is a Republican, and a conservative one at that.\n   \n      Asked by Raju on Tuesday if Democrats were open to the idea of a sort-of Speaker McHenry, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said this, which sounds very open indeed:\n   \n      “Our focus right now relates not just to any one individual, but to getting the institution reopened,” said Jeffries, although he added that he and Democrats hold McHenry in high regard. “I think he is respected on our side of the aisle,” Jeffries said.\n   \n      A speaker, even a temporary one, elected with bipartisan support, would be a major structural pivot in the House of Representatives, which has been governed by partisan speakers for centuries.\n   \n      Sarah Binder, a Brookings Institution senior fellow in governance studies and a George Washington University professor, has been posting on X (formerly known as Twitter) about how there is precedent for appointing a speaker pro tempore when it’s not possible to have a speaker. \n   \n      I asked her by email about why having a temporary speaker would be appealing, and she suggested it’s not a good option, but maybe the least bad option in the face of an institutional leadership crisis.\n   \n      “A vacant speakership – for whatever reason – signals a potential crisis in the House,” Binder said, adding, “the goal is to get the legislative machinery of the House functioning again.”\n   \n      I asked if having a speaker with limited power is a return, in some way, to the original way the House speaker was supposed to function, as a more limited traffic cop for the chamber rather than the powerful party bosses we usually have today. She argued it would be “untrodden territory” if McHenry is given new power with help from both parties.\n   \n      Just because some Republicans and Democrats could (emphasis on the could; this is a very fluid situation) vote together for empowering McHenry does not portend a less partisan atmosphere on Capitol Hill, according to Joseph Postell, a politics professor at Hillsdale College. He   about the unprecedented nature of Republicans turning on McCarthy in the first place.\n   \n      In fact, Postell predicted an even more partisan atmosphere if the House speaker was to permanently become a less powerful position.\n   \n      “If the Speaker returned to a neutral presiding officer role,” Postell told me by email, “the Majority Leader would likely assume a lot of the power that the Speaker currently has.”\n   \n      Majority leader is a singularly partisan position, he added, elected by the majority party rather than the entire House. \n   \n      “This would make the leadership position more partisan, not less partisan,” he said.\n  "},

Ken Buck, a solid conservative from Colorado, said he might support Jordan if Jordan could simply admit in public that Trump lost the 2020 election.\n   \n      When reporters asked Jordan on Capitol Hill about Buck’s request, Jordan ignored them and silently got into an elevator.\n   \n      There are other important elements of Jordan’s professional biography.\n   \n      Jordan has played a very specific role in Congress, and it is not that of dealmaker, the main job requirement of modern House speakers. In fact, Jordan has never been the primary sponsor of a major piece of legislation that was enacted into law. \n   \n      The Center for Effective Lawmaking ranks members of Congress based on the amount of major legislation that bears their fingerprints, and Jordan’s rating is one of the lowest. Pushing for legislation is clearly not his priority.\n   \n      If you’ve watched a House hearing meant to provide oversight of a Democratic administration, Jordan was probably involved. \n   \n      He was a chief critic of Hillary Clinton during rounds of hearings related to the death of a US ambassador in Benghazi, Libya. More recently, he’s among the top Republican voices building up a political dossier to imply, without direct evidence, that President Joe Biden sought to benefit from his son Hunter’s career.\n   \n      “This is a guy that has basically made it very clear that his whole goal isn’t to govern, it’s not to legislate, it’s to destroy the Democrats,”  , the Republican former congressman turned Republican critic, during an appearance on the network earlier this month.\n   \n      During the Trump administration, Jordan was Trump’s chief defender during impeachment hearings preceding Trump’s first impeachment in the House.\n   \n      Kinzinger was one of the few Republican members of the House committee tasked with investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The committee dissolved in January 2023, when Republicans took control of the House.\n   \n      Republicans had   Jordan on the committee, but former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the proposal because of concerns about Jordan’s statements and actions.\n   \n      Members of the House January 6 committee referred Jordan to the House Ethics Committee for refusing to comply with their subpoena to testify.  \n   \n      But it is notable that special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has not charged Jordan with any crime related to the election.\n   \n      Here are the key points made about Jordan in the   that the House committee released in late 2022:\n   \n      When Trump’s then-attorney and henchman Rudy Giuliani wanted to continue to try to delay the counting of electoral votes after the storming of the Capitol on January 6, Jordan was among the lawmakers he called.\n   \n      When Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality, wanted to suggest that Trump stop talking about the election, he wrote a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Jordan.\n   \n      Jordan, according to the committee’s report, “participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud.”\n   \n      He took part in a January 2, 2021, conference call with Trump and others about “strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.”\n   \n      One topic of discussion: “issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump’s supporters to ‘march to the Capitol.’”\n   \n      The day before January 6, Jordan texted Meadows suggesting then-Vice President Mike Pence should “should ‘call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.’” \n   \n      Pence, notably and to his credit, did not believe that any of the electoral votes were unconstitutional because there was no evidence of fraud.\n   \n      Jordan was on the phone with Trump. The committee refers to   at least twice on January 6 and taking five calls from Giuliani after the insurrection, although three of the calls from Giuliani were not connected.\n   \n      After the insurrection, Jordan “spoke with White House staff about the prospect of Presidential pardons for Members of Congress.”\n   \n      Jordan’s elevation to the top position in the House and second in line for the presidential line of succession, should he be able to find the votes, would cement the election skeptic way of thinking as the  .\n   \n      That may not be a surprise since Republicans seem primed to elevate the election skeptic in chief, Trump, as their presidential nominee for the third time next year.

The president admitted to reporters that his emergency mission had been a risk but insisted he had pulled off a success.\n   \n      Still, given the huge political investment of American prestige and leverage involved in a sudden presidential trip, it’s fair to raise the question of what exactly Biden’s trip delivered.\n   \n      The trip’s wider goals never had a chance after a Tuesday  that Palestinian officials say killed hundreds sparked protests in multiple Arab nations. It was exactly the kind of incident that the president had hoped to prevent by traveling to the region, but his high-stakes trip came too late. Biden sided with Israeli claims that the explosion was caused by a misfiring Islamic Jihad rocket launched toward Israel – an assessment he said was backed up by US intelligence on the incident. \n   \n      But questions over the origins of the blast did little to defuse the fury that it triggered across the Arab world, where there is little confidence in the statements of the US or Israeli governments and great anger about the long-term treatment of the Palestinians.\n   \n      The tragedy prompted the cancellation of a critical onward leg of Biden’s visit to Amman, where he had been due to meet Jordan’s King Abdullah II, the Egyptian president and the leader of the Palestinian Authority. \n   \n      Instead of hosting a presidential summit, Amman on Wednesday was rocked by a second night of huge protests that crystalized anger in Arab nations over the Israeli pounding of Gaza. Demonstrations also erupted in Tunisia, Iraq, Iran, in the occupied West Bank and Lebanon. The US State Department advised Americans not to visit Lebanon, and the rising public unrest about the situation in Gaza appeared to harden the attitudes of key regional powers. For instance, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on “all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza” in a post on X, calling the blast at the hospital the “latest example of Israel’s attacks devoid of the most basic human values.”\n   \n      The meeting in Amman was going to be vital to Biden’s effort to balance his unequivocal support for Israel – after the killing of more than 1,400 civilians by Hamas and the taking of more than 200 hostages – with an effort to engage Arab leaders he needs to help contain the conflict. \n   \n      The fact that the king, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas were willing to snub the president of the United States – a key ally and aid donor – doesn’t say much for Washington’s leverage at this moment or hopes that Washington can save a regional peace initiative.\n   \n      The possibility that unrest across the Arab world could spread and cause instability is now likely to weigh on the political decisions of key leaders in the region – even those that are allied with the US.\n   \n      Biden may have exacerbated regional suspicions of the US role when he said the hospital explosion appeared to have been caused by the “other team.” This was a reminder of how Biden often creates tonally awkward moments that play into Republican claims that, at the age of 80, he may struggle to fulfill his role in a possible second term. The phrase also came across as flippant given the unspeakable horror that unfolded in the hospital in Gaza City, which was packed even before the blast because of Israel’s ongoing airstrikes as they go after Hamas. And more importantly, it also likely further eroded Biden’s capacity to perform a complex straddle vital to easing tensions in the region by operating as a third party between Israel and the US’ Arab allies.\n   \n      Biden endorsed Israel’s claim that the Islamic Jihad militant group was behind the strike, noting that he was working off assessments based on US Defense Department data. The National Security Council also said it believes Israel “was not responsible” for the attack. Islamic Jihad has denied involvement.\n   \n      The president’s reputation is also on the line over aid to Gazan civilians. He appealed to the Israeli cabinet to allow life-saving humanitarian assistance into the enclave from Egypt on the condition that it should go to civilians and not Hamas fighters.\n   \n      “As they probably told you, I was very blunt with the Israelis,” Biden told reporters on Air Force One on his way home. “Israel has been badly victimized, but the truth is if they have an opportunity to relieve the suffering of people who have nowhere to go, that’s what they should do.” \n   \n      “If they don’t,” he continued, “they’ll be held accountable in ways that may be unfair.” \n   \n      Biden also said he had spoken to the Egyptian president for over an hour on Air Force One and that Sisi had agreed to open the Rafah crossing into Gaza to 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid.\n   \n      The president said the road has to be fixed before the trucks could pass and that he expects them to be rolling Friday. The crossing would only open for aid, Biden said, not for evacuations.\n   \n      While the arrival of the trucks would mark a breakthrough, the level of need among civilians in Gaza who have nowhere to flee the Israeli attacks is immense. And there are questions over whether even the 20 trucks will make it through.\n   \n      “The devil is in the details,” Mark Regev, a senior Netanyahu adviser, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, arguing that past aid shipments had been stolen by Hamas.\n   \n      Not everything that happens on a presidential trip is visible. Private meetings with foreign leaders often yield understandings that influence future events. So immediate indications are not always a useful barometer over the effectiveness of such travel. But however much White House officials tried to downplay expectations, there was a clear imperative for Biden’s mission to tamp down tensions – a goal that was not achieved.\n   \n      Biden’s speech to the Israeli people, however, was an eloquent statement of support to an ally traumatized by a terror attack. And politically, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been weakened by the crisis, is now in the president’s debt so he may be more susceptible to US pressure. Calls for mercy for Palestinian civilians might get a better hearing among the angry and grief-stricken Israeli public given Biden’s willingness to travel to the country in a dark hour.\n   \n      Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to NATO, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Biden’s visit had been worthwhile in demonstrating that Israel was not alone. But Daalder also noted Biden’s allusions to how decisions born from anger and grief after the September 11 attacks in 2001 had led America down some dubious roads.\n   \n      “I think he did use the visit to engage Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war cabinet in some very serious conversations about the strategy that Israel has embarked upon,” Daalder said. “I think the president was sharing some doubt that, in fact, the current effort by Israel is moving in the right direction.”\n   \n      Biden also sent a warning to Israeli enemies other than Hamas – like Iran and Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah – that the US was prepared to do everything necessary to defend its ally. Biden’s presence bolstered the message sent by two aircraft carrier battle groups he has deployed to the area. \n   \n      “My message to any state or any other hostile actor thinking about attacking Israel remains the same as it was a week ago: don’t – don’t – don’t,” Biden said.\n   \n      But by failing to make any immediate breakthroughs, Biden’s trip also showed the limits of US leverage in a grave geopolitical situation and therefore suggested, worryingly, that it may not be possible to stop events spinning out of control. \n   \n       \n  "},
{"title": "\n      Will Trump’s rivals repeat the mistakes of their first debate?\n    ", "author": "Ronald Brownstein", "timestamp": "\n  Updated\n        6:52 AM EDT, Tue September 26, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n      The candidates who will gather for the   this week face an unusual challenge: how to take on a front-runner who’s not on stage and is already acting as if he’s the nominee.  \n   \n       ’s posture was symbolized by his decision to hold a general election-style   rather than attend the debate.\n   \n      Trump’s inclination to look past the primary, even before it’s officially begun, partially reflects the historic lead he has amassed in national polls. But it also derives from the failure of the other candidates to formulate a clear line of argument that might threaten him. That failure was on display during  , which he also skipped, when almost all of the field largely ignored him. \n   \n      “The best thing that Trump has going is that none of his opponents are running a strategy to defeat him,” said Mike Murphy, a long-time GOP strategist who has become a frequent Trump critic. “None of his major ones. They are just doing Trump impersonations.” \n   \n      The key question for the second debate may be whether anyone in the field can use Trump’s absence to make a stronger case against him – and force him to reconsider his strategy of virtually ignoring the field. “I can’t blame him for skipping the second debate,” Murphy said. “If they are not going to engage him, and they are just going to imitate him, then he doesn’t have to be there.”\n   \n      At the first debate last month, the candidates devoted very little attention to Trump, whom co-moderator Bret Baier accurately described as “the elephant not in the room.” Former Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, as usual, argued that Trump was unfit to serve as president, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley questioned his capacity to win a general election, calling him “the most disliked politician in America.” Haley, who served in his Cabinet as ambassador to the United Nations, also jabbed Trump over the increase in the national debt during his presidency.\n   \n      But those were little more than momentary exceptions in the 90-minute encounter. Apart from Christie and Hutchinson, all of the candidates indicated they would support Trump if he wins the nomination, despite the 91 felony criminal charges he’s facing. The candidates spent much more time sparring with each other than offering any reason for GOP voters to reconsider their support of the man who leads all of them by as much as 40 percentage points in national polls.\n   \n      Among Republicans skeptical of Trump, the most charitable explanation for the other candidates’ behavior was that they wanted to use their first nationally televised forum primarily to introduce themselves to voters. “That’s the best argument for why they did what they did: because American voters need to know who they are,” said Dave Wilson, a prominent social conservative activist in South Carolina, which holds the third primary on the GOP calendar.\n   \n      The uncharitable explanation in GOP circles for Trump’s relative absence from the debate discussion is that the other candidates are replicating the mistake of his opponents in 2016. In that race, the rest of the primary field also resisted attacking him directly, and instead focused on competing among themselves to become the principal alternative who would theoretically benefit if Trump somehow collapsed on his own. \n   \n      To many watching the first 2024 debate, this year’s crop of Trump competitors appeared engaged in similarly wishful thinking – or even to be running just to improve their chances of Trump picking them as his vice presidential nominee.\n   \n      If they are genuinely trying to win the nomination, Trump’s rivals have little to show for their deferential posture toward him at that first debate. Trump’s lead in  remains historically large and,  , has even increased slightly.\n   \n      Trump’s behavior has been just as revealing. Since the debate, he has signaled more overtly that he is already trying to position himself for a presumptive general election rematch with  . “I think there is no other conclusion than that to draw from what we are seeing,” says Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based GOP strategist.\n   \n      Trump is still campaigning in the early primary states – albeit less frequently than his opponents – with   this week and Iowa on Sunday, CNN has reported. But he still offered a window into his shifting focus when he decided to skip the debate for a speech with blue-collar workers Wednesday in Michigan, a state that will likely play a more important role in deciding the winner of the general election than of the Republican nomination.\n   \n      Even more revealing were his comments about abortion during his recent interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Much of the coverage arguably overstated how much Trump deviated from GOP orthodoxy: read carefully, his answers still clearly signaled he would sign a national abortion ban. The question he left open was not whether, but at what point of pregnancy he would accept a national limit: “What’s going to happen is you’re going to come up with a number of weeks or months,” Trump said. \n   \n      But Trump did specifically criticize the six-week abortion ban signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Such a “heartbeat” ban, notably, has also been signed by the Republican governors in Iowa and South Carolina, which along with New Hampshire, comprise the trio of early voting states that have typically decided the winner in GOP nomination fights. \n   \n      With those pointed comments, Trump seemed to be making a calculated bet that also underscores his brimming confidence about winning the nomination. Evangelical Christians represent a majority of the GOP voters in both Iowa and South Carolina, but especially in Iowa they have repeatedly delivered victory for the most socially conservative candidates, including Mike Huckabee in 2008, Rick Santorum in 2012 and Ted Cruz in 2016. By denouncing the state’s six-week abortion ban, Trump to many appeared to be accepting a higher risk of losing the Iowa caucuses as the price of improving his positioning for a possible general election. “It looks that way to me at the moment,” says Mackowiak.\n   \n      Trump’s bonds with his voters are forged more around issues of racial identity and anti-elite populism than traditional social issues, so it remains to be seen how much his comments on abortion may cost him among the social conservatives now in his camp. “Some core conservative pro-lifers are very upset by his comments, but the average voter who is a Donald Trump supporter I don’t think it is going to impact them that much,” says Wilson. “They are core Donald Trump supporters, period.”\n   \n      But at the least, Trump’s comments on abortion seem likely to prompt more attacks on him Wednesday than he faced at the first debate. When they differentiate from Trump at all, most of his rivals – DeSantis in particular – seem much more comfortable attacking him from the right as insufficiently conservative. And accusing Trump of slighting the anti-abortion cause offers them a clear opportunity to do so. \n   \n      The more difficult question for Trump’s rivals, especially DeSantis, is whether they would ultimately gain or lose more even in a GOP primary by defining themselves to Trump’s right on abortion. For DeSantis, that positioning at this week’s debate may be irresistible. The Florida governor is already following the same strategy that allowed Huckabee, Santorum and Cruz to win Iowa. Like them, DeSantis has burrowed deeply into the state, campaigning relentlessly there and focusing on mobilizing support among evangelical Christians by emphasizing his social conservative credentials.\n   \n      Though Trump still holds a commanding lead in most Iowa surveys, those precedents suggest it’s far from inconceivable that DeSantis (or, less likely, someone else) could consolidate support late and squeeze past him in the caucus.  \n   \n      The problem with that strategy, though, is that even after winning Iowa, Huckabee, Santorum and Cruz, of course, did not win the GOP nomination. None of them,  , even won more than a dozen states. They all confronted the same core problem: once defined as the champion of evangelical Christians, they struggled to attract broad support among GOP voters outside that community. That difficulty immediately became apparent in New Hampshire, the next contest after Iowa, where none of those three men attracted as much as 12% of the vote from an electorate with far fewer evangelicals. Trump’s team may be betting that even if DeSantis edges past him in Iowa with the Huckabee/Santorum/Cruz strategy, he’ll quickly hit the same wall.\n   \n      “The only way to beat Trump is really simple and really hard: you beat him in Iowa and you beat him in New Hampshire,” says Murphy. “That means you can’t run the Santorum campaign because it kills you in New Hampshire. You’ve got to beat him in both.”\n   \n      The potential limitations of DeSantis’ Iowa-first strategy could make Haley, who probably generated the most positive momentum out of the first debate, the most important candidate to watch this week. (Entrepreneur   also attracted substantial attention at the first go-around, but his hectoring performance probably did as much to lower the ceiling on his potential support as to raise the floor.)\n   \n      Because of Haley’s relatively more moderate positioning on abortion, she is unlikely to win the Iowa caucus. (While she personally supports abortion restrictions,   she does not believe there are the votes in Congress to pass a national ban on the procedure.) But if Haley finished well enough in Iowa to emerge from the caucus with momentum, she may have a more plausible path forward than any of Trump’s other rivals in the critical next two states on the calendar.\n   \n      Because she is not as defined as a culture warrior,   than DeSantis (or most of Trump’s other rivals) to ride a good Iowa result into a strong showing in New Hampshire, notes Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster. “If Haley came in second in Iowa, or even a strong third, then you go onto New Hampshire and it’s a totally different ballgame,” Ayres says.\n   \n      The most recent CNN/University of New Hampshire poll showed Haley joining essentially a four-person pile-up with DeSantis, Ramaswamy and Christie in second behind Trump. And if Haley can do well in New Hampshire, she has a natural base of support in South Carolina, the next state on the calendar. A  after the first debate found Haley leapfrogging DeSantis to emerge as the clear second place choice in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 until 2017.\n   \n      Even if Haley managed to emerge as Trump’s principal opponent after the first three states, she would face the challenge of expanding her appeal beyond the moderate and college-educated voters who are providing most of her support in these surveys. (The best evidence suggests that Trump has   even further toward the non-college educated voters who comprise his base.) The larger problem confronting Haley is the same one looming over all the candidates who will reconvene on stage this week: who finishes second doesn’t matter that much if Trump remains this far ahead of the field.\n   \n      Trump’s rivals have already ruled out most of the frontal arguments they could make against him. Apart from Christie, Hutchinson and former Texas Rep. Will Hurd, they have rejected the idea that his behavior after the 2020 election disqualifies him from the presidency. By largely echoing Trump’s claim that the multiple criminal indictments against him are politically motivated, they have discouraged GOP voters from seeing those as disqualifying either. And the potential argument that Trump can’t win a general election has been undercut by Biden’s current weakness in surveys, which have produced an array of polls showing the two men in a virtual dead heat.\n   \n      But other arguments less polarizing for a GOP audience remain available to them, many of Trump’s Republican critics note. As Ayres points out, the other candidates could even praise Trump’s performance as president but insist the party, and the country, needs a nominee “who looks to the future, not the past, and is not going to be consumed by personal grievance.” Haley has come closest to that message, but even she has leaned more heavily on convincing voters that Trump is not electable than that he is no longer the right person for the job.\n   \n      Mackowiak says the candidates’ deference toward Trump at the first debate reflected the GOP’s conventional wisdom “that until you are truly one on one with him…all you do by attacking him is hurt yourself and benefit someone else” in the field who stays out of the fight. The problem, he notes, is that while a strategy of minimizing conflict with Trump may be rational for each individual candidate, the collective result is irrational: no one is making a sustained case against a front-runner dominating all of them as the first votes draw nearer. The Republicans chasing the former president will only get so many chances to appeal to a big national audience before Iowa and New Hampshire begin the voting next winter. If they let this debate pass without forcefully challenging Trump, many Republican strategists believe they are certain to regret it. \n   \n      “As Yogi Berra once said,” Mackowiak notes, “‘it is starting to get late early out here.’”\n  "},

While the rates for these three groups hit record lows earlier in his presidency, he didn’t acknowledge that they have all since increased to non-record levels – and, in fact, are now higher than they were during parts of Donald Trump’s presidency.\n   \n      Here’s a fact check.\n   \n      Biden   in the Friday speech that Republicans want to “cut taxes for the very wealthy and big corporations,” which would add to the deficit. That’s fair game. \n   \n      But then he added: “I was able to cut the federal debt by $1.7 trillion over the first two-and-a – two years. Well remember what we talked about. Those 50 corporations that made $40 billion, weren’t paying a penny in taxes? Well guess what – we made them pay 30%. Uh, 15% in taxes – 15%. Nowhere near what they should pay. And guess what? We were able to pay for everything, and we end up with an actual surplus.”\n   \n       :  \n   \n      CNN has     Biden’s false claims about supposedly having cut the “debt” and about the new corporate minimum tax supposedly being responsible for deficit reduction in 2021 and 2022. The White House, which declined to comment on the record for this article, has   previous official transcripts when Biden has claimed that the debt fell by $1.7 trillion, acknowledging that he should have said deficit. \n   \n      As for Biden’s vague additional claim that “we end up with an actual surplus,” a White House official said Friday that the president was referring to how the particular law in which the new minimum tax was contained, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, is  . But Biden did not explain this unusual-at-best use of “surplus” – and since he had just been talking about the overall budget picture, he certainly made it sound like he was claiming to have presided over a surplus in the overall budget. He has not done so. \n   \n      Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank, said in response to the White House explanation: “Well he didn’t say ‘budget surplus’ I suppose. But in federal budget conversations, the word surplus has a very specific meaning. It doesn’t mean ‘additional,’ it means revenues exceed spending.” He noted earlier Friday that there hasn’t been a federal budget surplus since 2001.\n   \n      It’s worth noting, as we have  , that Biden’s Friday comments would be missing key context even if he had not inaccurately replaced the word “deficit” with “debt.” It’s highly questionable how much credit Biden himself deserves for the decline in the deficit in 2021 and 2022. Independent analysts say it occurred largely because emergency Covid-19 relief spending from fiscal 2020 expired as scheduled – and that Biden’s own new laws and executive actions have significantly added to current and projected future deficits. In addition, the 2023 deficit is widely   to be higher than the 2022 deficit.\n   \n       \n   \n      When Biden spoke Friday about “those 50 corporations that made $40 billion, weren’t paying a penny in taxes,” he was referring, as he has in the past, to an Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy   published in 2021 that listed 55 companies the think tank found had paid no federal corporate income taxes in their most recent fiscal year. \n   \n      But it was imprecise, at best, for Biden to say Friday that we made “them” pay 15% in taxes. That’s because the new 15% minimum tax applies only to companies that have an average annual financial statement income of $1 billion or more – there are lots of nuances involved; you can read more details   – and only 14 of the 55 companies on the think tank’s list reported having US pre-tax income of at least $1 billion. In other words, some large and profitable companies will not be hit with the tax. \n   \n      The federal government’s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation   last year that the tax would shrink deficits by about $222 billion through 2031, with positive impacts beginning in 2023. Gardner said Friday that he fully expects the tax to play a role in reducing deficits going forward, but he said its deficit-reducing impact “might be lower than expected” in 2023 because the Treasury Department – which has been the subject of intense   from corporations that could be affected – has taken so long to implement the details of the law that the Internal Revenue Service ended up   on companies that don’t make estimated tax payments on it this year. \n   \n      Regardless, Gardner said, “The minimum tax did not reduce the deficit at all in fiscal years 2021 or 2022 because it didn’t exist during those years.”\n   \n      Early in the Friday speech, Biden boasted of statistics from the September jobs report that was released earlier in the day. But then he said, “We’ve achieved a 70-year low in unemployment rate for women, record lows in unemployment for African Americans and Hispanic workers, and people with disabilities – folks who’ve been left behind in previous recoveries and left behind for too long.”\n   \n       :  \n   \n       : The seasonally adjusted women’s unemployment rate was 3.4% in September. That’s a tick upward from the 3.3% rate during two previous months of 2023, but it’s still tied – with two months of the Trump administration – for the lowest for this group since 1953, 70 years ago.\n   \n       : The seasonally adjusted Black or African American unemployment rate was 5.7% in September, up from the record low of 4.7% in April. The current 5.7% rate is higher than this group’s rates during four months of 2019, under Trump.\n   \n       : The seasonally adjusted Hispanic unemployment rate was 4.6% in September, up from the record low of 3.9% from September 2022. The current 4.6% rate is higher than this group’s rates for every month from April 2019 through February 2020 under Trump, plus a smattering of prior Trump-era months.\n   \n       : The unemployment rate for people with disabilities, ages 16 and up, was 7.3% in September, up from a record low of 5.0% in December 2022. (The figures only go back to 2008, so the record was for a period of less than two decades.) The current 7.3% rate is higher than this group’s rates during eight months of the Trump presidency, seven of them in 2019.\n  "},
{"title": "\n      It’s been 17 days without a speaker. Here’s what needs to happen in the House\n    ", "author": "Zachary B. Wolf", "timestamp": "\n  Updated\n        12:07 PM EDT, Fri October 20, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n      It’s been 17 days since eight Republicans were able to bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top position in Congress and hit pause on all legislative business on Capitol Hill.\n   \n      Having moved on from McCarthy and his No. 2, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third Republican choice, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio,   to perform the magic trick of uniting nearly every Republican behind him to get a House majority and reopen the chamber. \n   \n      Jordan, by the way, was once labeled by a Republican former speaker as among a group of “ ” for the way he thought they worked to tear apart Washington. \n   \n      If Jordan ultimately can’t get enough Republican votes, some Republicans could join with some Democrats behind a separate option – giving interim Speaker  temporary power to pass legislation.\n   \n      Here’s a look at what we know and what we can expect:\n   \n      The House is essentially paralyzed until someone is chosen to preside over it. \n   \n      A placeholder, McHenry, has the power to bring the chamber to order. But no legislation can pass until this is resolved. No government funding bills. No policy bills. To the extent that Congress is meant to address problems with legislation, that is not happening. \n   \n      First and foremost, the government essentially   in less than a month, on November 17. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats. \n   \n      There is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas this month. And Ukraine is said to be running out of munitions, although support has dropped in Congress for continued  . \n   \n      President Joe Biden has   that will include aid for Ukraine and Israel. \n   \n        was one of the shortest-serving speakers in US history. In order to get the job in January, he agreed to give any single Republican member the power to call for a vote to “vacate” him from the top spot. \n   \n      That was his undoing. Far-right   that McCarthy relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avoid a government shutdown late last month.\n   \n      McCarthy’s replacement will now have a month to tackle the larger problem of a yearlong spending bill before the government again faces the prospect of a funding lapse.\n   \n      Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary,   as the Republican nominee to be speaker. He got the support of a majority of Republicans in a secret ballot vote but not enough to become speaker. He’s lost three separate votes before the full House. \n   \n      He can only afford to lose three GOP votes on the floor, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not shrinking.\n   \n      A founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Jordan made his name as somewhat of a flamethrower on Capitol Hill. A 2020 election skeptic, Jordan was among former President Donald Trump’s most vocal defenders in Congress, fealty Trump rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in his final days in office. \n   \n      That such a conservative lawmaker would be elevated to the top spot in the House speaks volumes about how the GOP has evolved in the age of Trump. Jordan   earlier this month when it was a two-way race with Scalise. \n   \n      Jordan has also faced scrutiny over his position as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University at the time that a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was sexually abusing male students. Some of the abused have publicly argued Jordan heard and ignored their complaints in the 1990s. The Ohio Republican has vehemently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the abuse.   \n   \n      Jordan is among the conservative members whom one former speaker, retired Rep. John Boehner, described as “political terrorists” in his memoir. \n   \n      “I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart – never building anything, never putting anything together,” Boehner told CBS News of Jordan in 2021.\n   \n      Jordan told CNN’s Manu Raju he can unite the party.\n   \n      “I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I’m the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,” he said.\n   \n      Jordan has used his position as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to begin investigations into   and  , who are both prosecuting Trump.\n   \n      There are   in the House. Subtracting two vacant seats plus any absences from the normal total of 435 members means 217 or potentially fewer is the current threshold for a majority. \n   \n      Democrats are unified behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n   \n      They vote again. And again. And again, until either one candidate gets a majority or there is a recess. \n   \n      If this sounds familiar that’s because it took McCarthy 15 rounds of voting and multiple days to build a majority of Republicans in January.\n   \n      The clerk of the House will gavel in the chamber and call a quorum. Democrats will place Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans will nominate Jordan.\n   \n      Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot.\n   \n      There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.\n   \n      Not at the moment, but it’s important to note that Jordan is far from their first choice. All but eight Republicans had backed keeping McCarthy, but because Republicans’ majority is so small, he lost his job.\n   \n      Then, Republicans nominated Scalise, the House majority leader. But Scalise was far from a universal choice, and rather than work to change the minds of his doubters by horse-trading for their votes, from contention.\n   \n      Anyone will face a difficult task in unifying a party that includes far-right members such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who engineered McCarthy’s ouster, as well as 18 members who represent districts that would have voted for Biden in 2020 under redrawn lines.\n   \n      It was McCarthy’s decision to give any Republican the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. There are voices in both parties who want to see that power controlled. A majority could change the rules Republicans adopted in January. \n   \n      Jordan has not taken an official position but made clear the first order of business is selecting a speaker. They can revisit whether a speaker should be removed at a later date. \n   \n      This makes a lot of sense to a lot of moderates. Giving McHenry power until the end of November or the end of the year would allow lawmakers to pass government funding bills and give Republicans a chance to figure out who their leader should be. \n   \n      Democrats have indicated they are open to helping the plan get the majority vote it would need. But details can be difficult. Many Republicans oppose the perception of working with Democrats in a  . Democrats have not entirely endorsed the plan.\n   \n      In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 15 times,  .\n   \n      All but two of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.\n   \n      Until it took McCarthy 15 ballots in January, a floor fight had taken place only once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for  of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.\n   \n      In 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority. \n   \n      The process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders, who answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery.  .\n   \n      It’s also interesting to  ; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.\n   \n       \n  "},
{"title": "\n      The number one takeaway from Biden’s address\n    ", "author": "Stephen Collinson", "timestamp": "\n  Updated\n        9:01 AM EDT, Fri October 20, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n        task, as he looked America in the eye from the Oval Office, was to explain why a nation wearied by its own foreign quagmires and political estrangements   to help other people fight their wars.\n   \n      His answer was that  and   were fighting existential struggles and that their wars were not just their own but were critical to the security of each American watching his primetime speech on Thursday. \n   \n      But the most profound takeaway from what was only his second Oval Office address was this: While Biden scheduled the appearance to discuss two nations fighting for their survival against outside attack, his real topic was America itself – and perceived threats to its foundational values in a volatile political age. \n   \n      He implored his country to honor the global role that has cemented a stable world order since World War II and to reject the appeasement of terrorists and tyrants. And in remarks that foreshadowed a reelection bid that will help decide the character of America and its place in the world for years to come, he sought to inspire it to reject intolerance as bitter politics rage at home.\n   \n      Biden delivered   hours after   and meeting victims of the Hamas terror attacks that killed more than 1,400 civilians, and months after his daring trip to another war zone in Ukraine. Even as he spoke, the first signs of an expected Israeli incursion into Gaza began to unfold, suggesting a crisis he sought to contain with his trip on Wednesday is about to get far worse.\n   \n      “I know these conflicts can seem far away, and it’s natural to ask – why does this matter to America?” Biden said. “So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America’s national security.”\n   \n      The president beseeched Americans to understand that if the “pure unadulterated evil” of Hamas and the attempt by Russian President Vladimir Putin to “erase” Ukraine’s independence prevailed, terrorism emanating from the Middle East would threaten Americans again and Russia would imperil global peace.\n   \n      Biden’s address is likely to be seen by historians as a signature moment in his presidency because of the messages he sent to American allies and foes abroad and how he sketched his vision for his own deeply divided nation. \n   \n      Biden’s words did not unfold in a vacuum. They came against a backdrop of a looming election in which he is likely to face  . In 2024, as in the previous two elections, the nation will likely face a choice between the internationalism and conventional statesmanship of Biden – and all his recent predecessors bar Trump – and the “America First” nationalism of the “Make America Great Again” movement, which disdains foreign alliances and a traditional US global leadership role. Pro-Trump Republicans do not begrudge defending Israel, for reasons partly rooted in the importance to evangelical voters, but would leave Ukraine defenseless against one of those tyrants. \n   \n      Biden sought to make sense of confusing and frightening events overseas, diagnosing the danger and suggesting a path forward consistent with American leadership, values and status as the world’s “indispensable nation.” He is asking Congress to approve $100 billion to help Israel and Ukraine defend themselves – a current impossibility with one half of the legislative branch essentially frozen  and the narrow GOP majority in chaos. \n   \n      Global chaos, however, is Trump’s friend, as he promises to restore strongman leadership and argues only he can keep Americans safe. The ex-president is warning that Biden risks triggering World War III and has signaled he’d seek an accommodation with Putin rather than defend Western style democracy in Ukraine. \n   \n      Soon after Biden’s address, Trump’s campaign released a video featuring turmoil in the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, hitting US aid for Ukraine and highlighting the recent attack in Israel. It finished with a caption. “Joe Biden. Foolish. Incompetent. Weak.”\n   \n      The very first point that Biden made in his address – that the world is at an “inflection point” – is borne out by events that threaten to play into Trump’s conceit. A gathering front opposed to US power was encapsulated this week as Putin traveled to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was in North Korea, and Israel reeled from attacks by Hamas, which receives funding and weapons from Iran.\n   \n      The ex-president would also change the fabric of America by vowing to reinstate his ban on Muslim immigration from some nations if he wins back the White House – a move his critics see as an infringement of the same constitutionally enshrined religious tolerance Biden argued was quintessentially American. Days after   of a six-year-old American boy of Palestinian descent in Chicago, Biden warned, “Here in America , let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms, all forms of hate, whether against Muslims, Jews or anyone. That’s what great nations do. And we are a great nation.”\n   \n      While he rooted his argument in lofty appeals to America’s purpose, Biden faces a vexing political problem. Support for maintaining Ukraine’s multi-billion dollar lifeline – to which he wants to add another $60 billion – is waning in a nation still suffering the after-effects of the pandemic, high inflation and the punishing impact of high interest rates. Republicans are increasingly opposed to arming Ukraine any longer – a stance that threatens Kyiv’s ability to prolong its resistance to Putin. \n   \n      While there is broad bipartisan support for sending more vital aid to Israel ahead of its expected offensive against Hamas in Gaza, Congress is paralyzed. The meltdown of the Republican House majority is offering a preview of what a potential full return to power by MAGA forces in Washington might look like. \n   \n      The failure of the GOP to agree on a new speaker after the ouster of Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago is not just casting doubt on vital US aid to bolster the fights of Israel and Ukraine. It is sending a message of dysfunction and internal US weakness to rivals like Russia, China and Iran, whose foreign policies are both rooted in challenging the US-led international order and weakening American power.\n   \n      Biden’s decision to combine aid requests for Israel and Ukraine will trigger a fierce political clash in Washington. As will his contention that both are US allies engaged in a similar fight for their survival and for US-style democratic values. The president said his emergency budget request was actually to “fund America’s national security” by supporting “critical partners including Israel and Ukraine.” The administration has also informed lawmakers it plans to seek $14 billion for border security in its new funding package, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez reported Thursday evening. \n   \n      Biden faces resistance from Republicans – especially in the House – who are happy to finance Israel’s struggle against Hamas but who don’t see Ukraine as a critical US interest. While there is a majority in the Senate GOP for aiding Ukraine, Ohio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance encapsulated the pro-Trump wing’s views on the war with a social media post after the president’s address. “What Biden is doing is disgusting. He’s using dead children in Israel to sell his disastrous Ukraine policy to skeptical Americans,” Vance wrote on X. “They are not the same countries, they are not the same problems, and this effort to use Israel for political cover is offensive. Hell no.”\n   \n      Polls show that Americans do not necessarily buy Biden’s position that the threats to Ukraine and Israel are the same. In a  released in August, 55% of respondents said Congress should not authorize more funding to support Ukraine. In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attacks in Israel, however, 76% of Americans in a   said the US should send humanitarian aid to Israel with roughly half backing the dispatch of weapons and supplies.\n   \n      Biden’s address, with the familiar backdrop of US and presidential flags in the Oval Office felt like a throwback to an earlier age — when presidents would interrupt primetime on the handful of TV channels at a moment of national crisis. In the age of TikTok, and a fractured and partisan media where conspiracy theories reign, the idea that a commander in chief can convene a moment of national unity seems quaint. \n   \n      Like many of Biden’s speeches, this one looked better on paper than as a political spectacle. While his arguments stood comparison with classic presidential statements of the past, his address had none of the inspirational cadence, for instance, of President John F. Kennedy vowing America would “pay any price, bear any burden” to secure the survival of liberty abroad. Biden’s frequent verbal stumbles, a nagging cough and eyes narrowed by age meant this was far from a stirring appeal — and will only fuel the debate over whether he could fulfill the duties of a possible second term that would begin when he is 82.\n   \n      Like President Harry S. Truman, Biden’s trips to the bully pulpit are marked more for simple truculence than linguistic eloquence. But there was still the sense of a president taking his country into his confidence at a moment of national peril.\n   \n      The coming months will tell whether sufficient numbers of Americans are prepared to listen to a president whose low approval ratings reflect his struggles to make good on his 2020 promise to restore normality and global stability. \n  "},
{"title": "\n      Mideast crisis will test whether Biden can make experience an asset\n    ", "author": "Ronald Brownstein", "timestamp": "\n  Published\n        10:02 AM EDT, Sat October 21, 2023\n    ", "content": "\n      The escalating confrontation between Israel and Hamas is offering President Joe Biden a crucial opportunity to begin flipping the script on one of his most glaring vulnerabilities in the 2024 presidential race.\n   \n      For months, polls have consistently shown that most Americans believe Biden’s advanced age has diminished his capacity to handle the responsibilities of the presidency. But many Democrats believe that Biden’s widely praised response to the Mideast crisis could provide him a pivot point to argue that his age is an asset because it has equipped him with the experience to navigate such a complex challenge. \n   \n      “As you project forward, we are going to be able to argue that Joe Biden’s age has been central to his success because in a time of Covid, insurrection, Russian invasion of Ukraine, now challenges in the Middle East, we have the most experienced man ever as president,” said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. “Perhaps having the most experienced person ever to go into the Oval Office was a blessing for the country. I think we are going to be able to make that argument forcefully.”\n   \n      Biden unquestionably faces a steep climb to ameliorate the concern that he’s too old for the job. Political strategists in both parties agree that those public perceptions are largely rooted in reactions to his physical appearance – particularly the stiffness of his walk and softness of his voice – and thus may be difficult to reverse with arguments about his performance. In a  , about three-fourths of adults said Biden did not have “the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively as president” and nearly as many said he does not inspire confidence. Even about half of Democrats said Biden lacked enough stamina and sharpness and did not inspire confidence, with a preponderant majority of Democrats younger than 45 expressing those critical views.\n   \n      But the crisis in Israel shows the path Biden will probably need to follow if there’s any chance for him to transmute doubts about his age into confidence in his experience. Though critics on the left and right in American politics have raised objections, Biden’s response to the Hamas attack has drawn praise as both resolute and measured from a broad range of leaders across the ideological spectrum in both the US and Israel.  \n   \n      “Biden is in his element here where relationships matter and his team is experienced (meaning operationally effective) and thoughtful (meaning can see forests as well as trees),” James Steinberg, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and deputy secretary of state under former President Barack Obama, wrote in an email.\n   \n      Similarly, David Friedman, who served as ambassador to Israel for then-President Donald Trump, declared late last week, on Fox News Channel no less, that “The Biden administration over the past 12-13 days has been great.”\n   \n      These responses underscore the fundamental political paradox about Biden’s age, and the experience that derives from it. On the one hand, there’s no doubt that his age is increasing anxiety among Democrats about his capacity to serve as an effective candidate for the presidency in 2024; on the other, his experience is increasing Democratic faith in his capacity to serve as an effective president now.\n   \n      While more Democrats have been openly pining for another, younger alternative to replace Biden as the party’s nominee next year, many party leaders argued that there was no one from the Democrats’ large 2020 field of presidential candidates, or even among the rising crop of governors and senators discussed as potential successors, that they would trust more at this moment than Biden.\n   \n      “No one – not a one,” said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, an organization of centrist Democrats. “That is genuinely the case. And I get people’s uneasiness about him both because he’s old and he has low poll numbers. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t the best person for the job.”\n   \n      Familiarity with an issue is no guarantee of success: Biden took office with a long-standing determination to end the American deployment in Afghanistan but still executed a chaotic withdrawal. But in responding to global challenges, Biden, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972, is drawing on half a century of dealing with issues and players around the world; even George H.W. Bush, the last president who arrived in office with an extensive foreign policy pedigree, had only about two decades of previous high-level exposure to world events.\n   \n      This latest crisis has offered more evidence that Biden is more proficient at the aspects of the presidency that unfold offstage than those that occur in public. It’s probably not a coincidence that the private aspects of the presidency are the ones where experience is the greatest asset, while the public elements of the job are those where age may be the greatest burden.\n   \n      Biden’s speeches about Ukraine, and especially his impassioned denunciations of the Hamas attack over the past two weeks, have drawn much stronger reviews than most of his addresses on domestic issues. (Bret Stephens, a conservative New York Times columnist often critical of Biden,   that his first speech after the attack “deserves a place in any anthology of great American rhetoric.”) In Biden’s nationally televised address about Israel and Ukraine on Thursday, he drew on a long tradition of presidents from both parties who presented American international engagement as the key to world stability, even quoting Franklin D. Roosevelt’s call during World War II for the US to serve as the “arsenal of democracy.”\n   \n      But even when Biden was younger, delivering galvanizing speeches was never his greatest strength. No one ever confused him with Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or Barack Obama as a communicator and his performance as president hasn’t changed that verdict. Instead, Biden has been at his best when working with other leaders, at home and abroad, out of the public eye. \n   \n      Biden, for instance, passed more consequential legislation than almost anyone expected during his first two years, but he did not do so by rallying public sentiment or barnstorming the country. Rather, in quiet meetings, he helped to orchestrate a surprisingly effective legislative minuet that produced bipartisan agreements on infrastructure and promoting semiconductor manufacturing before culminating in a stunning agreement with holdout Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to pass an expansive package of clean energy and health care initiatives with Democrat votes alone. \n   \n      “He’s showed a degree of political dexterity in managing the coalition that would have been very challenging for anyone else,” said Rosenberg. “His years of actually legislating, where he learned how to bring people together and hash stuff out, was really important in keeping the Democratic family together.”\n   \n      To the degree Biden has succeeded in international affairs, it has largely been with the same formula of working offstage with other leaders, many of whom he’s known for years, around issues that he has also worked on for years. In the most dramatic example, that sort of private negotiation and collaboration has produced a surprisingly broad and durable international coalition of nations supporting Ukraine against Russia.\n   \n      Biden’s effort to manage this latest Mideast crisis is centered on his attempts through private diplomacy to support Israel in its determination to disable Hamas, while minimizing the risk of a wider war and maintaining the possibility of diplomatic agreements after the fighting (including, most importantly, a rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia meant to counter Iranian influence). Administration officials believe that the strong support that Biden has expressed for Israel, not only after the latest attack, but through his long career, has provided him with a credibility among the Israeli public that will increase his leverage to influence, and perhaps restrain, the decisions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n   \n      The president “wisely from the very moment of this horror show expressed unfettered solidarity with Israel and that allowed him to then go to Israel and behind closed doors continue the conversation, which I’m sure Secretary [Antony] Blinken started,” said one former senior national security official in the Biden administration, who asked to be anonymous while discussing the situation. That credibility, the former official said, allowed Biden to ask hard questions of the Israelis such as “‘Ok, you are going to send in ground troops and then what? We did shock and awe [in the second Iraq war] and then we found ourselves trapped without a plan. What are you doing? What’s the outcome? Who is going to control Gaza when you’re done whatever you are doing? At least stop and think about this.’”\n   \n      In all these ways, the Israel confrontation offers Biden an opportunity to highlight the aspects of the presidency for which he is arguably best suited.  In the crisis’ first days, former President Trump also provided Biden exactly the sort of personal contrast Democrats want to create when Trump   to the tragic Hamas attack by airing personal grievances against Netanyahu and criticizing the Israeli response to the attack. For some Democrats, Trump’s off-key response crystallized the contrast they want to present next year to voters: “Biden is quiet competence and Trump is chaos and it’s a real choice,” said Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, vice president and chief strategy officer at Way to Win, a liberal group that funds organizations and campaigns focusing on voters of color.\n   \n      Ancona said Biden’s performance since the Hamas attack points to the case Democrats should be preparing to make to voters in 2024. “He’s been a workhorse not a show pony, but that’s something we can talk about,” she said. “You can show a picture of a president working quietly behind the scenes, you can tell a story of how he has your best interests at heart. It is what it is: he’s, what, 80? You can’t get around that. But I do think he has shown he has the capacity and strength and tenacity to do this job. He’s been doing it. So why shouldn’t he get a chance to keep doing it?”\n   \n      Likewise, Rosenberg argues, “In my view you can’t separate his age from his successes as president. He’s been successful because of his age and experience not in spite of it, and we have to rethink that completely.”\n   \n      Other Democrats, though, aren’t sure that Biden can neutralize concerns about his age by making a case for the benefits of his experience. One Democratic pollster familiar with thinking in the Biden campaign, who asked for anonymity while discussing the 2024 landscape, said that highlighting Biden’s experience would only produce limited value for him so long as most voters are dissatisfied with conditions in the country. “The problem with the experience side is that people feel bad,” the pollster said. “If people felt like his accomplishments improved things for them, they wouldn’t care about his age. … The problem with the age vs. experience [argument] is that experience has to produce results for them, but experience isn’t producing results.”\n   \n      William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and long-time Democratic strategist, sees another limit to the experience argument. Like most Democrats, Galston believes that Biden’s response to the crisis has, in fact, demonstrated the value of his long track record on international issues. “This is where all of his instincts, honed by decades of experience, come into play,” Galston said. “He knows which people to call when; he knows whom to send where. As was the case in [Ukraine], this is the sort of episode where Biden is at his best.”\n   \n      The problem, Galston argues, is that voters can see the value of Biden’s experience in dealing with world events today and still worry he could not effectively handle the presidency for another term. “It’s not a logical contradiction,” Galston said, for voters to believe that “‘Yes, over the first four years of his presidency, his experience proved its value, and he had enough energy and focus to be able to draw on it when he needed it’ and at the same time say, ‘I am very worried that over the next four years, in the tension between the advantages of experience and disadvantages of age, that balance is going to shift against him.’”\n   \n      To assuage concerns about his capacity, Biden will need not only to “tell” voters about the value of his experience but to “show” them his vigor through a rigorous campaign schedule, Galston said. “The experience argument is necessary, but not sufficient,” Galston maintains. “In addition to that argument, assuming it can be made well and convincingly, I think he is going to have to show through his conduct of the campaign that he’s up for another four years.”\n   \n      Biden’s trips into active war zones in Ukraine and Israel have provided   that his campaign is already using to make that case. As Galston suggests, the president will surely need to prove the point again repeatedly in 2024.\n   \n      But most analysts agree that what the president most needs to demonstrate in the months ahead is not energy, but results. His supporters have reason for optimism that Biden’s carefully calibrated response to the Israel-Hamas hostilities will allow them to present him as a reassuring source of stability in an unstable world – in stark contrast to the unpredictability and chaos that Trump, his most likely 2024 opponent, perpetually generates. But Biden’s management of this volatile conflict will help him make that argument only if its outcome, in fact, promotes greater stability in the Middle East. If nothing else, Biden’s long experience has surely taught him how difficult stability will be to achieve in a region once again  on the edge of explosion.\n  "},

It’s one of his strongest issues among voters. The same can be said of his policy on Russia’s war on Ukraine, which is another subject of Thursday night’s speech. \n   \n      Take a look at polling released by   on Tuesday.  A number of the questions asked in the survey on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are illuminating (keeping in mind, of course, that events can shift opinions). \n   \n      Just 13% of registered voters answered that their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians than the Israelis based on what they know about the Middle East.\n   \n      Sixty-one percent said their sympathies lie with Israel, which was the highest amount of support Israel had received on this question since Quinnipiac first started asking it in 2001. It’s up considerably from 41% back in 2021, when Quinnipiac last posed the question to voters when Israel was in armed conflict with Hamas. A Fox News poll taken just after Hamas’ attack on Israel last week also showed that voters’ sympathy for Israel had climbed since 2021. \n   \n      Notably, much of this shift from 2021 is being driven by Democrats. Democratic support for Israel compared to Palestinians has been declining for over a decade.\n   \n      In Quinnipiac’s latest poll, 48% of Democratic voters say their sympathies are more with Israelis compared to 22% who said Palestinians. That’s a massive change from the 46% for Palestinians and 23% for Israelis in May 2021. Fox’s poll, likewise, has shown support for Israel up by 17 points among Democrats compared to 2021.  \n   \n      When it comes to America’s role as a strong ally of Israel in this conflict, more than half of Democrats polled by Quinnipiac appear to be more likely to side with Biden when it comes to support for Israel. Although 28% of Democratic voters believe America has been too supportive of Israel, 60% say America’s support has been about right.\n   \n      A majority of voters (52%) concur that America has it right when it comes to support for Israel. The rest are split evenly between saying America is too supportive (20%) and not supportive enough (20%). \n   \n      Indeed, the issue of support for Israel is one of Biden’s strongest. More voters, polled by Quinnipiac, approve of Biden’s response to Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel (42%) and his policy towards Israel overall (42%) than disapprove (37% and 39% respectively).\n   \n      These +5 percentage point and +3 percentage point net approval ratings are significantly higher than his overall net approval rating (which is -18 percentage points). \n   \n      Another issue on which Biden does relatively well is what the US is doing to support Ukraine after Russia invaded the country – the other major topic of his speech on Thursday night. The Quinnipiac poll shows 47% of voters approve of Biden’s response to the invasion, while 45% disapprove. \n   \n      And as held with Israel (76%), most voters agree with Biden that supporting Ukraine (65%) is in America’s national interest. \n   \n      This may be one of the reasons why Biden felt comfortable with the US providing Ukraine with long-range missiles in recent days,  . Those missiles will reportedly allow Ukraine to hit Russian targets that had been out of reach. \n   \n      This positive polling for Biden on Ukraine hides some divisions, however. While Democrats are more likely to say that backing Ukraine is in America’s national interest (87%) than they are for Israel (76%), Republicans are the opposite (84% on Israel and 49% on Ukraine). \n   \n      Republicans’ skepticism about backing Ukraine lines up with other polling questions.  The clear majority of Republicans (61%) say we’ve done too much for Ukraine, which is up from 7% at the beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n   \n      Still, it would be a mistake to say it’s just Republicans who are causing Biden a polling headache on Ukraine. Even as Americans support Ukraine, the appetite for Congress approving more aid for the country in its war efforts is lackluster. \n   \n      A CNN/SSRS poll from August found that 55% of voters overall were opposed to it, including 71% of Republicans. Many Republicans in the US House have been wavering on giving more funding to Ukraine. \n   \n      Biden’s job is to try and get some of those Republicans who support Ukraine’s efforts on board with funding.\n   \n      Whether Biden will be able to do so is unclear. He’ll have an easier time on Israel, where a majority of Democrats (59%), independents (61%) and Republicans (79%) approve of America giving weapons and military equipment to the country in response to Hamas’ attack. \n   \n      All that said, Biden is speaking to his strengths on Thursday night when discussing either Israel or Ukraine. He’s much better off politically talking about these issues than pretty much anything else.\n  "}
